According to the latest request, the country says Israel’s military incursion in Rafah threatens the “very survival of Palestinians in Gaza”.\n\nDuring hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza, saying it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.\n\nIn January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.\n\nThe court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.\n\n“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.\n\nICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.\n\nA 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.\n\nMost of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.\n\nSouth Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nOn Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case.

First of all, Kyiv needs to be provided with long-range missiles.\n\nThis was the call to the West made by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in an interview with The Kyiv Independent published on Sunday, January 14. In her opinion, this is the only way to repel the aggressor country.\n\nThe head of the Estonian government reminded that Tallinn had officially decided to provide Kyiv with annual aid of 0.25% of its GDP over the next 4 years. She called on partners and allies to make the same decision.\n\nKallas said that the joint budgets of the countries that are members of the Ramstein format contact group on Ukraine's defense are \"much larger\" than Russia's budget.\n\n\"Every month, Moscow spends about 5.3 billion euros on the war. If we take the total budgets and this 0.25% of the GDP of all the states of the Ramstein coalition, it will be 120 billion. Such assistance would turn the tide in Ukraine's favor. The partners should provide Kyiv with all the military equipment they have,\" said the Estonian prime minister.\n\nThe absence of long-range weapons in the Ukrainian army gives the Russian occupation forces an advantage to seize more territories, Kallas noted.\n\n\"If they (Russians - Ed.) think they can win, then of course they don't feel threatened and just keep hitting Ukraine,\" the official said.\n\nShe also added that some Western countries are afraid that Moscow will lose and what consequences it will have. According to Kallas, the main task now is to end the war.\n\nSpeaking in the Estonian parliament on January 11, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine must win the battle against Russia because it is about the survival of the Ukrainian people.\n\nAs OBOZ.UA previously reported, the head of state called on the West to strengthen support for Ukraine.

[bold, links added]\n\n…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”\n\nHe also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”\n\nEchoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.\n\nAnd he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”\n\nFinally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party.

Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result…\n\nJamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don’t like that.

In return, the Germans should agree to resuming their war against Russia on US terms.\n\nThis was known in Washington as the M PROJECT. It was devised by a group of American co-religionists, with a common ethnic origin and a shared belief in the evil of everything Russia stood for, including their religion.\n\nThe M PROJECT was the brainchild of the head of US intelligence, the White House military advisor, and other generals and admirals. They were all Irish-American Roman Catholics.\n\nThrough a special emissary code-named DAISY, they attempted to recruit their German co-religionists in the plan. To earn their reward, the Germans’ job was to arrange a coup d’état in Berlin; kill Adolph Hitler; and hurry up, before the Russian Army made good its advance through Ukraine, Poland, and on to Berlin.\n\nThis was the M PROJECT of 1943. President Franklin Roosevelt knew nothing of it. It failed, but the secret was kept for more than thirty years. By then, the US didn’t need to persuade the Germans by killing their chancellor.

The increasingly erratic weather, along with pressure to cut the forests that harbor the orchids, is particularly worrisome for farmers…”\n\nSo, why does the Times provide just anecdotal ‘evidence’ of climate change ravaging vanilla crops, and why does the Times have to go back to 2017 to find any such anecdotal evidence?\n\nThe answer is that objective facts expose the Times’ claim as false.\n\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization provides detailed information on global crop production, including vanilla. According to the UN data, global vanilla production has doubled from 3.9 million kg of vanilla in 2000 to 7.7 million kg in 2022.\n\nThere is so much vanilla being produced that farmers are complaining about low vanilla prices caused by overproduction.\n\n“The 2023 vanilla crop is expected to be one of the best harvests in the last two decades, forecasted at 2,500 tons with exceptionally high quality,” observes the Nielsen-Massey 2023 Crop Report.\n\nThe Crop Report observes that recent strong production has created a market oversupply. “The oversupply has led to aggressive price reductions, posing economic challenges for vanilla farmers as they sell their 2022 crop at low prices to meet their daily living needs,” the Crop Report adds.\n\nWow, talk about the New York Times getting the story completely backward and wrong!\n\nThe New York Times points to a cyclone that hit Madagascar seven years ago during its cyclone season and caused a very short-term spike in vanilla prices.\n\nThat is its sole “evidence” of climate change making vanilla go extinct.\n\nIn reality, vanilla production is so strong that the market is saturated with vanilla, … making farmers complain about low prices.\n\nThe New York Times and other “mainstream” media outlets have a long history of identifying popular foods, beverages, and luxury items that climate change is allegedly destroying.\n\nAs is the case with all other such items that have come to Climate Realism’s attention, vanilla is becoming more abundant rather than less abundant as the planet modestly warms.\n\nTop photo of the Vanilla bean plant by Kristy An on Unsplash\n\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200150.txt": {"The New York Times": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}

Earlier, Russian detachments also made a series of tactical advances south of Adeevka and in the area of Marrinka in the countryside of Donetsk.\n\nThese developments on the frontline took place amid the long-expected death of the grain deal under the shelter of which the Kyiv regime and its sponsors used the Odessa port infrastructure for military purposes. \n\nApart from these actions, the West sabotaged the implementation of the part of the deal related to the Russian interests. Therefore, the fate of the deal was de-facto predetermined from its very start. The recent series of massive attacks aimed against the Republic of Crimea and the Crimean Bridge became a logical continuation of this approach.\n\nIn such conditions, Russia carried out a series of strikes on military objects placed within the Odessa port infrastructure. \n\nOn July 18, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a group strike with precision sea-based weapons against facilities involved in preparations of attacks with unmanned boats as well as a ship repair plant near Odessa, where these boats were manufactured or at least partly assembled. \n\nAdditionally, storage facilities with a total of about 70,000 tonnes of fuel were destroyed close to Nikolayev and Odessa. These facilities were used to supply fuel for the military hardware of the armed forces of the Kyiv regime. On the next day, on July 19, the Russian military delivered another round of strikes on such targets. E\n\nxplosions were reported in the countryside of Odessa, including the Illichevsk port area where a large fuel storage depot was allegedly destroyed. Other sources claim that strikes also hit positions of Ukrainian air defense facilities in the Radujniy area.\n\nThe cost of the Russian withdrawal from the grain deal and strikes on the Odessa port infrastructure for Kyiv and its puppeteers already exceeded any damage suffered by Russia from terrorist attacks aimed against Crimea. \n\nNonetheless, NATO HQs demonstrate little ability to draw conclusions from observed reality. On July 19, Crimean authorities shut down a local highway and ordered the evacuation of about 2,200 people from four settlements in the east of the peninsula. The decision was made after an ammunition depot in the area close to the evacuated villages “caught fire”. \n\nReports say that the fire was caused by a strike launched by the Kyiv regime.

{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_CC_200337.txt:\n'Met Office Says it Cannot Back Up its Senior Meteorologist’s Claim on BBC Radio That Storms in the U.K. are “More Intense” Due to Climate Change \n\n The Met Office has been unable to back up a claim that storms in the U.K. are “more intense” due to the effects of climate change. The claim was made by senior Met Office meteorologist Claire Nasir on January 22nd on BBC 5 Live Breakfast in the aftermath of Storm Isha, and led to a freedom of information request for an explanation by investigative journalist Paul Homewood. The Met Office has replied that it is unable to answer the request due to the fact that the information “is not held”.\n\nIn fact the Met Office could have addressed the claim that storms are growing in intensity by referring to its own ‘State of the Climate 2022’ report:\n\nThe most recent two decades have seen fewer occurrences of maximum gust speeds above these thresholds [40/50/60 knots] than during previous decades, particularly comparing the period before and after 2000. This earlier period [before 2000] also included among the most severe storms experienced in the U.K. in the observational records including the ‘Burns Day Storm’ of January 25th 1990, the ‘Boxing Day Storm’ of December 26th 1998 and the ‘Great Storm’ of October 16th 1987. Any comparison of storms is complex as it depends on severity, spatial extent and duration. Storm Eunice [in 2022] was the most severe storm to affect England and Wales since February 2014, but even so, these storms of the 1980s and 1990s were much more severe.\n\nAn explanation for the remarks broadcast unchallenged on the BBC was provided by the Met Office, “in order to provide advice and assistance”. The statement about more intense storms being due to climate change was, the Met Office explains, in reference to “our published U.K. Climate Projections, looking at projections in the future”. This is straight out laughable, since it seeks to justify a statement firmly in the present with waffle about future modelled projections. Paul Homewood comments that it is “small wonder that so many have little confidence in the Met Office anymore”. Meanwhile, the Global Warming Policy Foundation has demanded that the Met Office retracts the “false ‘more intense storms’ claim”. The foundation notes that there is no compelling trend in maximum gust speeds recorded in the U.K. since 1969.\n\nOf course these remarks by Claire Nasir are just the latest in a long line of scares that are being spread by state-funded operations promoting the collectivist Net Zero project. In the mainstream media there is little or no push back on often outrageous and improbable claims of climate collapse and potential future human misery.\n\nIn December, the headlines were full of the news that London could suffer an endemic dengue plague by 2060 due to changes in the climate. The claim from the Health Security Agency arose from a computer model fed with an implausible rise in temperature of 3-4°C within 80 years. Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, called the claims “entirely fictional” and “shameless”. Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch commented that science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. “This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute,” he said.\n\nRead More: Met Office Says it Cannot Back Up its Senior Meteorologist’s Claim on BBC Radio That Storms in the U.K. are “More Intense” Due to Climate Change'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200337.txt": {"The Met Office": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "Claire Nasir": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}

In fact it’s a libertarian publication with a history of climate denial and opposing green policies. E.g. In 2018 Spiked published “The Myth of a Climate Crisis” by denier Ben Pile.\n\nSpiked claims to be independent, but between 2015-18 the website received $300,000 from the Charles Koch Foundation, an arm of oil giant Koch Industries and a major funder of climate denial.\n\nOn BBC Question Time, Whelan suggested the UK government invest in “new exploration of North Sea oil” to grow the economy.\n\nThis statement ignores fossil fuels’ role driving climate impacts and the associated financial risks.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) says any new fossil fuel extraction projects are incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C.\n\nClimate change is already hurting the world economy. Under current policies climate change impacts are projected to cost the UK 7.4 percent of GDP by 2100. Meanwhile, the growing net zero sector employs 850,000 people and is adding £71 billion in Gross Value Added to the UK economy.\n\nWhelan also claimed “wind turbines and solar panels are not going to keep us warm”. In fact, heat pumps, which are powered by electricity, are considered the greenest and most efficient way to heat homes with no need for oil or gas.\n\nHer claim also plays on a common falsehood that wind and solar power are unreliable. In fact in winter 2022, renewables provided more UK electricity than gas power stations: 27 percent of UK electricity was generated by wind, and wind and solar were the EU’s top power source.\n\nThe National Grid has said the UK can switch to a 100 percent renewable grid led by wind and solar energy.\n\nIn the past, Whelan has claimed to care about climate change, for example in a 2022 interview with TalkTV.

They also ignore the urgent need to cut emissions and transition to green energy.\n\nSpiked writers like Ella Whelan are frequently hosted on mainstream media without mention of the publication’s history of climate denial and fossil fuel funding.\n\nWe hope this thread helps inform future media appearances by Spiked columnists, so that their claims can be challenged with evidence.

According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.\n\nDerkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.\n\nOn the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.\n\nAbout that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.\n\nThat’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.\n\nIn his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”\n\nLooking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.\n\nAltogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.\n\nThe dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_104859.txt": {"GUR": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Terrorist"]}, "Hunter": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}}}}

His actions violated the sanctions against Russia.\n\nExpressing deep remorse, Charles McGonigal pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for the purpose of money laundering.\n\nAccording to testimony before Judge Jennifer H. Rearden, Mr. McGonigal committed his violation of the IEEPA during the spring and fall of 2021, when he accepted over $17,000 to assist Russian energy mogul Oleg Deripaska by gathering negative information about one of Deripaska’s competitors.\n\nSentencing is set Dec. 14 for Mr. McGonigal, 55, who could spend up to five years in prison.\n\n“After his tenure as a high-level FBI official who supervised and participated in investigations of Russian oligarchs, Charles McGonigal has now admitted that he agreed to evade U.S. sanctions by providing services to one of those oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska,“ U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, according to the press release. ”This Office will continue to hold to account those who violate U.S. sanctions for their own financial benefit.”\n\nMr. Williams lauded the exceptional performance of the FBI New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division as well as the assistance provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the New York City Police Department.\n\nThe Former Agent’s PositionFrom 2016 to 2018, Mr. McGonigal oversaw the FBI’s counterintelligence operations in New York as special agent in charge. He directed probes of Russian oligarchs such as Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, Washington banned nearly two dozen Russian billionaires and government officials in response to the now-debunked allegations of collusion between then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. Among those targeted was Mr. Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminum firm Rusal.\n\nMr. Deripaska’s sanctions were upheld by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the court found evidence he had acted as an agent for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMr. McGonigal, who wept as he spoke about his crime, said Mr. Deripaska had sent him at least $17,000 via a bank in Cypress and a firm in New Jersey before depositing the money into his bank account.\n\nIn January 2023, authorities alleged that Mr. McGonigal had received undisclosed payments from Mr. Deripaska in exchange for investigating a rival oligarch and unsuccessfully pushing to lift U.S. sanctions on the Russian billionaire.\n\nAccording to a news release issued by the Department of Justice on Jan. 23, it was alleged that Mr. McGonigal, on behalf of Mr. Deripaska, “fraudulently used a U.S. entity to obscure their activity in violation of U.S. sanctions.”\n\nConnection to TrumpMr. McGonigal joined the FBI in 1996 and worked on Russian foreign counterintelligence and organized crime before taking part in probes into the crash of TWA Flight 800, the 1998 terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.\n\nIn 2016, he was promoted to head of the FBI’s New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division.\n\nThe DOJ was able to monitor Mr. Page’s communications because of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant issued during President Trump’s 2016 campaign.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that the West is “fed up” with the money pit that has become this war.\n\nPlus, the U.S. has now gotten itself involved in another war between Israel and Palestine, which has the potential to advance to World War 3. Speaking at a meeting with Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Lavrov argued that “everyone is fed up” with Zelensky, the Russia 1 TV channel reported on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the broadcaster, the diplomat quoted Romanian Senator Diana Sosoaca, who directed an angry tirade at the Ukrainian president ahead of his visit to Bucharest last week. We all know that this war is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., so there’s no way the rulers are going to stop financially backing Ukraine.\n\nSosoaca called on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to prevent Zelensky, whom she described as an “arrogant and unconscionable traitor, including to his own country,” from addressing the Romanian parliament. The politician further warned of “bad” consequences should she “catch” the Ukrainian president at the parliament building. “We are going to war for Zelensky’s grain! March out of our country, godless man! If you think we will sit idly by, you are wrong!” Sosoaca stated.\n\nStop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War\n\nAccording to Romanian media, the Ukrainian leader’s planned speech to parliament was canceled during his visit last Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference alongside Johannis, Zelensky insisted that he had never intended to make an address.\n\nThe opinion of Kiev in Romania has been adversely affected by the recent inflow of cheap Ukrainian grain into the country, coupled with what some see as discriminatory treatment toward the Romanian ethnic minority in Ukraine. –RT\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings in Marrakech on Saturday, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko admitted that Kiev is being forced to make “twice the effort right now to convince our partners to provide us with support compared to the last annual meetings [in spring].” Part of that is because the U.S. has found another war to support, and one involving religion will be easier to escalate.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300043.txt": {"Zelensky": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent", "Traitor"]}}}}

He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.\n\nOver the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow’s claims.\n\n“If you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,” Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.\n\nIn his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the ‘dirty bomb’ plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.\n\n“They can come, but I am telling you that a ‘dirty bomb’ is not a very complex device,”Polyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart.\n\nAt the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a ‘dirty bomb’ remains “very high,” and that Ukraine “has the opportunity” and “has every reason to use it.”\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission’s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a ‘dirty bomb’ by Ukraine “an act of nuclear terrorism.”\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations “as absurd as they are dangerous.” He also noted that “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to “prove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.”\n\n“Good cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia’s ‘dirty bomb’ disinfo campaign,” Kuleba said.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that “all parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what’s already a devastating conflict.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia’s allegations against Ukraine were “transparently false.” NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies “reject the allegation” and believe that Russia “must not use it as a pretext” for further escalation.\n\nSource: https://tapnewswire.com/2022/10/russia-exposure-of-dirty-bomb-plans-caused-panic-in-kiev/\n\nAnyone can join.\n\nAnyone can contribute.\n\nAnyone can become informed about their world.\n\n\"United We Stand\" Click Here To Create Your Personal Citizen Journalist Account Today, Be Sure To Invite Your Friends.\n\nHumic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex\n\nHerbAnomic’s Humic and Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex is a revolutionary new Humic and Fulvic Acid Complex designed to support your body at the cellular level.

He didn’t inherit an economic catastrophe. He inherited an economy that was growing above six percent. He inherited an economic boom. So, everything since then has been a lie.”\n\n“We got inflation because they lied that we were in an economic catastrophe, so they overspent,” he continued. “So, of course, right now you’re thinking, ‘Why can’t I make sense of this?’ It’s because it’s just lies.”\n\nCarney then zeroed in on Biden’s “middle out and bottom up” claim.\n\n“Nobody I’ve talked to can explain what ‘from the bottom up and the middle out’ means at all,” he said. “And that’s also not what they’re doing. When they are having government-directed money flowing into the economy—you know, all the subsidies for the Green New Deal stuff—that’s not from the bottom up. That’s the top down.”\n\n“It’s a grift,” Kudlow added. “It’s money to donors, campaign donors. It’s money to big corporations who buy into their DEI and climate change stuff. It’s money to Democratic interest groups city by city, state by state. You are so right. It’s totally top down.”\n\n“It’s not working either, because the American people are rejecting it all of the time. Whenever you see polls, they say they don’t trust Biden,” Carney noted.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans believe Biden’s economy is “poor,” and 64 percent disapprove of his management of the economy.\n\nCarney also commented on Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department, noting that despite the numbers coming in under expectations, the report “almost guarantees two more hikes” from the Federal Reserve.\n\nHe made this same point in Friday’s Breitbart Business Digest, explaining that the June jobs report and data showing a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly wages “are likely enough to lock-in a rate hike at the end-of-the-month Federal Open Market Committee meeting and tilt the balance in favor of another rate hike in September.”\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200154.txt": {"President Joe Biden": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}, "Biden": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}

The idea was proposed via a study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and serves as a collaboration between NOAA and NASA, but has not been put into practice. A NASA spokesperson denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.\n\nFact Check:\n\nA “fresh group of NASA astronauts” who just completed basic training will participate in the first Boeing Starliner test launch in May, according to Space.com. The launch will be a week-long mission, the outlet reported.\n\nIn the Facebook video, an unnamed male claims NASA is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change based on an article from Unilad. The video, which originally stems from TikTok, has garnered over 1,000 views as of writing.\n\nThe claim is false, however. The Unilad article, published on Mar. 1, 2024, makes it clear that injecting ice particles into the atmosphere is only a “proposed solution” and has not been put into practice. The article also indicates the proposal is a collaboration between NASA and NOAA and references a recent piece from the Daily Mail that cites a study conducted by NOAA physicist Josh Schwarz.\n\nAccording to the study, the concept is called intentional stratospheric dehydration and “would involve dispersing small particles (known as ice nuclei) into high altitude regions of the atmosphere that are both very cold and super-saturated in water vapor. These nuclei would increase the formation of ice crystals that otherwise would not have formed.”\n\n“This ‘[ISD]’ strategy would not counteract a large fraction of the forcing from carbon dioxide but may contribute to a portfolio of climate interventions by acting with different time and length scales of impact and risk than other interventions that are already under consideration,” Schwarz and his co-authors wrote in the same study.\n\nLikewise, Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to support the claim. In fact, the opposite is true. Both Lead Stories and USA Today debunked the claim in Mar. 8 and Mar. 15 articles, respectively. (RELATED: No, 80 Percent Of Texas’ ‘Cattle Grazing Land’ Was Not Destroyed By Recent Fires)\n\nAdditionally, the claim is neither referenced on NASA’s website nor its verified social media accounts. NOAA also has not publicly commented on the claim.\n\nNASA Spokesperson Allard Beutel denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.\n\n“This is an unfortunate mischaracterization of a study done by another agency.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal claimed he had “no idea” what happened to the funds.\n\nPhilippot also pointed to a recent corruption scandal involving Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Nikolay Solsky, who is accused of illegally appropriating state land worth nearly €6.9 million ($7.4 million). “Yet another case of corruption in this country, which is one of the most corrupt on the planet!” the French politician remarked.\n\n“Every euro sent to Ukraine prolongs the war and therefore causes unnecessary deaths, impoverishes us here, and has a strong chance of enriching the corrupt!” he added, calling for the conflict to be resolved as soon as possible.\n\nUkraine has been plagued by widespread graft for years, and a 2015 Guardian article described it as “the most corrupt nation in Europe.” More recently, it ranked 104 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index.\n\nThe issue has taken center stage during the conflict with Russia, including in the Ukrainian military, which has been rocked by several graft scandals in recent months.

Moreover, Ukrainian terrorists were praised for progress they made during the years-long cooperation with their partners in the US. Inspired by fame, the Kiev regime doubled its efforts to launch more attacks against the Russians. In recent days alone, a lot of the attacks failed but some were partially successful.\n\nOn the morning of October 27, pro-Russian politician Oleg Tsarev was targeted with an assassination attempt in Crimea. He was shot and hospitalized with heavy wounds. The victim has been a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine since 2002. In 2014, he supported the referendum on independence in Donbass and served as the speaker of the Parliament of Novorossiya.\n\nUnfortunately, Oleg Tsarev was far from the first victim of the Nazi Kiev regime, which has been hunting for politicians, journalists and public figures because of their positions for more than a decade.\n\nKiev also continues attempts to launch terrorist attacks in various cities of Russia. Their goals are to inflict civilian casualties and threaten the population, as well as to discredit the Russian authorities and create the appearance of a national resistance against the Kremlin. To do this, Kiev recruits naive men, often Ukrainians who have moved to Russia, who for monetary rewards go to a life of crime and sacrifice their lives.\n\nOn October 26, the FSB announced the elimination of a Ukrainian agent who wanted to stage a terrorist attack on one of the military enlistment offices in Tver.\n\nThe man was a member of some “Ukrainian nationalist formation”. He provided Kiev with data on military, fuel and energy facilities in the region. During the arrest, the man resisted and was killed. The FSB seized homemade explosives and an RGD-5 grenade on the spot.\n\nMilitary enlistment offices are frequently targeted by the Ukrainian special services. Kiev is trying to create the appearance that Russian men do not want to fight and resist the Kremlin’s policies.\n\nCases have become frequent when Ukrainian scammers under various pretexts forced women to set fire to military enlistment offices in different Russian cities. For example, victims were assured that they should stage the attack to check the effectiveness of local emergency services and so on.\n\nSometimes Kiev shows more ingenuity to assure Washington that the years of training and funding have not passed for nothing.\n\nFor example, a Ukrainian who has been living with his family in Moscow for many years recently tried to poison Russian pilots.

Such fundamental legal foundations of world economic relations as free competition and the immunity of property have been destroyed,” the Russian diplomat noted.\n\nLavrov went on to assert that the American currency has long been used as a weapon, adding that “destructive actions” by Western nations have resulted in producing the opposite effect to the intended one. The diplomat argued that US-led sanctions aimed at isolating Russia and crippling its economy in reality have stimulated the “strengthening of multipolarity in international affairs.”\n\nAccording to Lavrov, there is a growing awareness in the world that “no one is immune” in the face of the “aggressive actions of Washington and Brussels.”\n\nHe noted that not only Russia but many other countries are now “consistently” reducing their dependence on Western currencies by switching to alternatives for foreign-trade settlements.\n\nThe global trend towards using national currencies in trade instead of the US dollar began to gain momentum last year after Ukraine-related sanctions saw Russia cut off from the Western financial system and also saw its foreign reserves frozen.\n\nAs multipolarity takes shape, more nations are working on creating new transport corridors and supply chains. Meanwhile, an “unfair” and “unbalanced” model of globalization has become outdated, Lavrov said.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300013.txt": {"The West": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator", "Tyrant"]}, "The US": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator"]}}}}

{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_CC_200254.txt:\n'Biden regime's war on your appliances just widened with new attack on dishwashers, under guise of 'climate change' \n\n Under the guise of 'fighting climate change,' the regime has now proposed new regulations that target some of the most commonly used household appliances, including dishwashers. According to Fox Business, the Department of Energy has proposed new rules that would reduce the current limits for water and energy use in dishwashers.\n\nThe proposed rules would limit dishwashers to using 3.2 gallons of water per cycle, significantly lower than the current limit of 5 gallons, and manufacturers would need to reduce their products’ energy consumption by almost 30 percent. Even though most dishwashers available on the market already meet or exceed the current federal standards, the proposed rules have left some questioning why the Biden administration is focusing on such regulations rather than other priorities.\n\n“Dishwashers are not the only appliances Biden’s DOE has set its sights on, however, as the regulator is also considering crackdowns on washers, dryers and refrigerators that manufacturers say could reduce performance,” Fox Business noted further.\n\nMembers of the regime have been clear: The rule changes pertain to Biden’s ‘climate agenda.’\n\n“Collectively these energy efficiency actions … support President Biden’s ambitious clean energy agenda to combat the climate crisis,” the DOE wrote earlier this year.\n\n“This Administration is using all of the tools at our disposal to save Americans money while promoting innovations that will reduce carbon pollution and combat the climate crisis,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stated in a Friday news release.\n\nCritics have also poked major holes in the regime's claim that the new rules are going to save American consumers oodles of money each year.\n\n“The department estimates that consumers will save $3 billion over the next 30 years, or $100 million per year, on their utility bills thanks to the rougher rules,” Christian Britschgi wrote at Reason. “That’s a pretty small per capita savings when spread across the 89 million dishwasher-owning households.”\n\nIn fact, he noted that the new rules actually might lead to more water use:\n\nThe new regulations might lead to more water usage as individuals switch to washing dishes by hand, Britschgi pointed out, citing research from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).\n\nThe think tank’s proposal led President Donald Trump’s administration to approve a new class of dishwashers that clean dishes in one hour, though Biden’s team repealed the pro-consumer regulatory agenda of his predecessor.\n\nThe proposed dishwasher regulations follow a recent debate over gas stoves at the national level. Despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s reassurances that there is nothing to be concerned about, just last week his home state of New York prohibited gas stoves.\n\n“Nobody is taking away your gas stove,” Schumer tweeted in early February. “Shameless and desperate MAGA Republicans are showing us they will cook up any distraction to divert from real issues the American people want solved, like the debt ceiling.”\n\nThat turned out to be 100 percent false, obviously.\n\n“Nevertheless, New York lawmakers agreed to ban gas stove hookups in all future buildings in late April. The ban will affect new construction on small buildings in 2025 and move on to larger buildings by 2028,” Fox Business added.\n\nIn a statement last month, Consumer Product Safety Commission Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr., a Democratic activist and labor union leader, suggested that stoves could pose a “hidden hazard” to users and that \"any option is on the table.\" However, after receiving backlash, Chairman Alex Hoehn-Saric clarified that the agency had no plans to ban stoves.\n\nBut in February, the Energy Department went ahead with a new proposal that would allow government regulators to write energy consumption standards for the appliances, the Daily Wire reported.\n\nSources include:'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200254.txt": {"Biden": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "Schumer": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}

Taking that ingredient out of the growth media leads to an enormous cost savings.\"\n\nIn other words, the real beef industry is being attacked on all sides with mysterious fires and lawsuits while the emerging synthetic beef industry is making major strides in reducing production costs.

This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday morning following Russia’s announcement.\n\nRussia did not say how many units were being withdrawn, and how far, after a build-up of some 130,000 Russian troops to the north, east, and south of Ukraine. Video footage posted online by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday allegedly showed Russian tanks moving back to their permanent bases and away from the border.\n\nNATO said that it has yet to see evidence of a de-escalation in the crisis.\n\n“Russia has amassed a fighting force in and around Ukraine unprecedented since the cold war. Everything is now in place for a new attack,” Stoltenberg said. “But Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution.”\n\nThe Kremlin said Tuesday’s developments were proof that Western talk of war had been both false and hysterical.\n\n“February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed.

It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.” ( – Joseph Toomey, below)\n\nTalented amateurs are often better than the ‘professionals’ when it comes to dissecting U.S. energy policy. Or maybe I have it reversed. The pros are those in the trenches and the amateurs are the ones on high.\n\nSo let’s call Joseph Toomey, independent management consultant, an expert. Here is his recent post about the much-in-the-news problems of the offshore wind industry under Biden Energy Policy.\n\nNot long ago, this thread reiterated a resolute, long-standing belief that Offshore Wind is neither practical nor affordable, even in high-tax Democrat-governed Blue States of the U.S. Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions. Four proposed Offshore Wind projects had collapsed into miserable failure after project sponsors demanded increased public subsidies of as much as 65% above the already wildly-inflated feed-in prices they had previously been promised by New York State.\n\nJust this week, it was New Jersey’s turn to be left looking like adolescents for pretending that Offshore Wind could ever become a viable option for supplying the electricity needs of that state’s ratepayers at affordable levels.\n\nNote the delicious fury from New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy who proclaimed that:\n\n“Today’s decision by Ørsted to abandon its commitments to New Jersey is outrageous and calls into question the company’s credibility and competence.”\n\nIt was Murphy himself whose competence had been called into question by backing these wildly infeasible ideas.\n\nIf this sounds a little too much like a “Spike the Football” moment for our valuable readership, you have my deepest condolences. I just fell off my armchair laughing at the hilarious incompetence of our renewable energy-promoting political class. The day can’t come soon enough when real adults return into leadership positions to pull humanity back from the brink of extinction events that actually exist, as recent troubling global developments adequately demonstrate.\n\nThe Biden administration’s preposterous plan to establish 30,000 megawatts of nameplate Offshore Wind capacity by 2030 was always a pipedream. It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.\n\nThe badly-needed adult supervision delivered by marketplace realities has now demonstrated to sentient humans that there was never a chance in the whole universe that Biden’s absurd plan could ever be realized.\n\nActivate to view larger image,\n\nComments on Post\n\nSome of the many comments that followed either confirmed the obvious or suggested the way forward.\n\nThe obvious from Robert Borlick: “Notice how many days with no output? This is why wind needs to be backed up with dependable generators that can be ramped up to serve the load.”\n\nThe way forward from Ken Urkosky: “All this subsidy funding should go to building infrastructure capable of withstanding the harsher weather events we’re told to expect! That would be much more effective in reducing the impacts of climate change vs trying to control our Earth’s climate.”\n\nAnd Borlick, an important voice in the electricity debate, has had enough with offshore wind:\n\nI strongly opposed the OSW projects that were approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission in 2017 and again in 2021. Both awards violated Maryland law by not conducting valid cost-benefit analyses, which would have eliminated all but one project (US Wind). I tried to persuade the Maryland People’s Counsel to sue the MPSC but they wimped out – both times.\n\nNow the crazies in the Maryland legislature want to approve even more OSW but this time they want to hide the huge subsidies by paying them out of general tax revenues, instead of through the more visible electricity rate increases.\n\nMy hope is that cost increases will kill the Maryland projects just as they did the New Jersey projects.\n\nThe last word goes to engineer Greg Gardner: “BUT, it made a lot of congresspersons rich… that was the real plan.”'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200188.txt": {"Biden administration’s": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "Murphy": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "Maryland Public Service Commission": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}}}}

This coincided with Biden banning mining in the Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota, which is marked by four major iron ore deposits. (Related: FORCE MAJEURE: Massive global shutdowns are now under way for METALS SMELTING operations covering iron, copper, nickel, aluminum, zinc and STEEL.)\n\nAccording to Alpha News, the bill on the mining ban got passed after seven hours of debate with the Republicans, who offered several amendments to make the timeline more manageable but got rejected.\n\nThe junked amendments included \"lifting the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants; allowing for the use of carbon sequestration technologies; and delaying the standard to consider its impact on child and slave labor in the green energy supply chain.\"\n\nRep. Spencer Igo (R-Wabana Township) said at a press conference ahead of the debate that the bill will make \"Minnesota reliant on nations around the globe that have no labor standards and no environmental standards. Minnesota in this bill will build a clean grid economy on the backs of child slaves in China and poor environmental regulations in Indonesia and the Congo.\"\n\nIgo lamented that the resources to build a clean energy future are right there in Minnesota, which leads the nation in iron ore production, but the federal government opted to ban mining in the state.\n\n\"The third-largest deposits of copper, nickel and cobalt that exist in the known world are only 250 miles north of this Capitol. Instead of investing in those resources … we have decided to export it around the world where carbon emissions will be 20, 25 or 30 times higher than if we were to do it here in Minnesota,\" Igo said.\n\nSecretary of the Interior Deb Haaland signed Public Land Order 7917, which withdraws around 225,504 acres of land in the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota from mineral leasing, according to a Jan. 26 press release.\n\nThe move drew criticism from mining associations and lawmakers who believe mining is necessary for the country's mineral security and could harm the interests of Twin Metals, a major mining company that seeks to build an underground mine in Ely, a small city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota.\n\nRep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), who represents the region where a proposed copper-nickel mine was to be set up by Twin Metals, called the Biden administration's decision \"an attack on our way of life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, National Mining Association CEO Rich Nolan said the decision is \"nonsensical\" considering that the U.S. is looking to be a \"leader in manufacturing, innovation and climate.\"\n\nAccording to Nolan, the government has imposed the mining moratorium at a time when the demand for minerals like nickel, cobalt and copper is \"skyrocketing\" because of their \"widespread application in solar and wind infrastructure as well as electric vehicles.\"\n\nNolan pointed out that these lands could provide U.S. manufacturers with \"plentiful sources\" of minerals apart from providing high-paying domestic jobs. Further, the country is losing out on mining operations that would have been implemented in compliance with environmental and safety regulations.\n\nOf course, these observations wouldn't be heeded by Biden and the Democrats.

It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government.” Well, a solar company in Arizona is receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies this year, the overwhelming majority of its operating profit. That’s right. Your tax dollars are working to prop up a toxic and unreliable energy source under the Biden administration.\n\nHere is the full quote from Rush Limbaugh:\n\nClimate change is not about climate change. It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government. It’s all about expanding the government and government control over people. It’s about creating victims. When you successfully turn somebody into a victim, you have automatically made them a dependent on you. You are essentially telling them they have lost the power necessary to solve their own problems. And you create within them a mentality that they can’t overcome their own problem because they’re victims.\n\nThis whole paragraph is absolutely true, but I’m going to focus on the first point made. Climate change certainly allows many young people to feel virtuous for engaging in destructive or pointless demonstrations while they claim that the problems in their lives are caused by some vaguely defined climate catastrophe, one which government has to fix for them. Most of all, however, the climate scam is a way of enriching its proponents in government and business.\n\nRelated: Climate Expert: Gas Car Cancellation Is Intended to End Private Transport\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported July 31 that Arizona-based solar panel manufacturer First Solar “expects to receive as much as $710 million this year—nearly 90% of forecast operating profit—from subsidies the U.S. government rolled out a year ago to encourage domestic renewables production.” WSJ added, “One analyst estimates the incentives could be worth more than $10 billion for the company over the next decade.” Talk about hitting the jackpot.\n\nFrom WSJ:\n\nFirst Solar expects to have as much as a 60% share of the U.S. market for large-scale solar installations this year, largely a result of government policies that are pushing clean-energy developers to buy more made-in-America components.\n\nThe company’s shares have more than doubled to $208.40 in Friday trade since the beginning of 2022, despite a string of earnings disappointments during that period.\n\nThe manufacturer has even announced a new factory.\n\nWhat is not being said here is that solar panels generate lots of toxic waste and are unreliable as an energy source. Also, solar panels have killed billions of birds. Meanwhile, huge swathes of natural scenery and farmland must be ruined to set up solar panels. Solar is also unprofitable when left to survive on its own merits; that’s why so many government subsidies are needed. Solar panels are a terrible choice, both for the environment and for the energy grid. They are not a solution to the fake climate crisis.\n\nAs the above Limbaugh quote noted, it’s a money-making scam.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200218.txt": {"Biden": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}, "First Solar": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}}}}

Climate Ambition Summit in New York. “Distraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods; sweltering temperatures spawning disease; and thousands fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.”\n\nThis summer, he said that “the era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived” (emphasis added).\n\nHe also claimed that the “dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,” adding that the “climate breakdown has begun.”\n\nGuterres has placed the blame for the climate crisis on “our fossil fuel addiction,” insisting that “climate is imploding faster than we can cope.”\n\nWhile wild hyperbole and theatrical rhetoric may work in advertising, one cannot help but wonder whether they do not diminish the seriousness of Mr. Guterres’ case and indeed of his office.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200052.txt": {"António Guterres": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Bigot"]}, "Pakistan": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Exploited"]}, "Guterres": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}}}}

However, there is another viewpoint.\n\nEconomic observers have long known that there are no free lunches, and perhaps it’s time that electric-car fans did as well.\n\nLeftists extol Teslas and other electric cars as cure-alls for fossil fuels’ woes – even when it comes to something as simple as their tires – but disregard the tremendous environmental damage these vehicles cause.\n\nBrad Templeton, a Forbes contributor, related a story of his electric car tearing through pricey tires at breakneck speed.\n\nDespite praising the many advantages of electric vehicles over traditional internal combustion engines, Templeton admitted that the requirement for tire replacement at short intervals is an inconvenient downside.\n\n“The doozy was needing new tires at around 28,000 miles,” Temple writes in “Electric Vehicle Maintenance Is Super-Cheap, But The Dark Secret Is Tires” from last month.\n\n“That was too early, far before their rated life.”\n\n“One reason for this was a stupid mistake on my part. In the past, I’ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.”\n\nElectric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.\n\nLike Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.\n\nNonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles – fewer environmental impacts for a higher price – is having the opposite effect.\n\nRegular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.\n\nGiven that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.\n\nSomehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green”? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls\n\n— Patrick De Haan ⛽️📊 (@GasBuddyGuy) November 11, 2021\n\nMicroplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n“Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green?” Author Patrick De Haan wrote of the deadly bargain greenies have made with batteries made from land-scarred processes.\n\nWhile proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and environmental costs are rising faster than ever before.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_100004.txt": {"Al Gore": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "China": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Foreign Adversary"]}, "ete Buttigieg": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}

His message? Ukraine’s war with Russia and Putin is Europe’s fight, too.\n\nThe court is the legal arm of the Council of Europe, the continent’s foremost human rights body, which expelled Russia from its ranks more than two years ago after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The expulsion means that the court has no enforcement powers over Russia.\n\nHowever, the ruling could bolster cases filed by individuals seeking reparations.\n\nMoscow maintains that it rightfully took over Crimea after an overwhelming majority of local residents voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in a referendum. It has continuously rejected accusations of human rights violations in the region.\n\nUkraine and most Western governments, including the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany, condemned the annexation of Crimea as illegal, calling the referendum a sham.\n\nIn the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia, a Russia-style bill targeting civil society and independent media nears final enactment amid protests. Critics see a Kremlin hand.\n\nIn its written ruling, the court found Russia responsible for breaches including enforced disappearances and the abuse of Ukrainian soldiers, ethnic Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and journalists.\n\nIt also held Moscow responsible for discrimination including the harassment and intimidation of religious leaders, cracking down on non-Russian media, banning public gatherings and expressions of support for Ukraine, and suppressing the Ukrainian language in schools.\n\nThe decision Tuesday by the human rights court comes six months after the top United Nations court ruled that Moscow breached an international treaty on eradicating racial discrimination by limiting school education in Ukrainian and by maintaining a ban on a Tatar assembly called the Mejlis.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300045.txt": {"Russia": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator"]}}}}

Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said she lives in Kenya with solar power and clean electricity from the local utility.\n\n“I'm not living in a cave,\" she added.\n\n\"That's all I can say.”\n\nThe remarks from Al Jaber draw criticism from scientists and are in contrast with the view of Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who said at the climate summit on Friday,\n\n“The science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.”\n\nAl Jaber’s presidency of COP28 has stirred controversy in recent months. He is the first CEO designated to be president of any climate summit so far.

The BBC cited leaked briefing documents obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working alongside the BBC.

And Hungary's CPI in December 2022 rose by 24.5 percent compared with the same month in 2021, the highest increase since March 1996. Food prices in Hungary also rose by 44.8 percent in December 2022, compared to the same month in 2021.\n\nSince the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, Europe has encountered a severe energy crisis. Bloomberg reported that Europe lost one trillion U.S. dollars by rejecting Russian energy while the U.S. is selling its LNG to Europe at three to four times the price in the U.S., which drew criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron, saying it is a practice that \"is not what true friends would do and must stop.\"\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto had said the beneficiary of Europe's recession is the U.S.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_DEV_216.txt": {"Europe": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "EU": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "Hungary": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Underdog"]}, "Europe's": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Exploited"]}, "the U.S": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Tyrant"]}}}}

Not for houses, not for farms, not for roads.”\n\n“I write this with a heavy heart, but I see no other way,” he said, adding: “I don’t expect the agricultural sector will be happy with this report.”\n\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced his intentions to cut nitrogen emissions from livestock farms in half by the year 2030 in order to satisfy goals laid out in the European Union’s Natura 2000 scheme, which requires that all EU member-states remove industry or farming from areas deemed to be of ecological importance.\n\nThe government has asserted to meet the EU goals, some farms may have to reduce their emissions by as much as 95 per cent and that up to 30 per cent of all livestock farms may be shut down permanently.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the scheme, thousands of farmers staged protests throughout the country, with tractors being used to block highways and other critical infrastructure, and farmers dumping manure, tyres, and hay on motorways in defiance of the green agenda.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM in July, Dutch political commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek said that her country was being used as a testing ground for the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset, saying that “all these policies are out of those institutions and they are being implemented in our country first, we are sort of the pilot country together with Canada for this agenda.”\n\nVlaardingerbroek went on to claim that the push from the government to seize farmland was, in fact, more a result of the migrant crisis than the alleged climate crisis, explaining that the government wants the land to house migrants. While not widespread as of yet, this has already occurred, with the province of Flevoland buying up land in Noordoostpolder to build an asylum processing centre on the site of a former farm.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200105.txt": {"World Economic Forum-": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}, "Netherlands": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Tyrant"]}, "Bill Gates": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "Mark Van den Oever": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Rebel"]}, "Farmers Defence Force": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Rebel", "Guardian"]}, "Canada": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Exploited"]}}}}

Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.\n\nThe issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.\n\nCritics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.\n\nAdvocacy groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots warn that AI technology’s dehumanisation poses significant risks. This dehumanisation could not only impact the use of force but also permeate other aspects of our lives, extending to automation in law enforcement, smart homes, and beyond. The campaign notes the urgent need for a global treaty banning autonomous weapons to prevent the wide-scale production and proliferation of these technologies from potentially falling into the wrong hands.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_021918.txt": {"China’s Liberation Army": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Foreign Adversary"]}}}}

In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.\n\nPutin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”\n\nNiinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.\n\n“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”\n\n“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA.

But instead of solving military tasks, they act in such a barbaric way. Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons,\" Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have killed and maimed Russian civilians.\n\nPutin further addressed Zelensky's efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland, to consider Kiev's 10-point peace plan, which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions.\n\n\"The so-called 'peace formula' that's being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia,\" Putin said, according to a translation in Sputnik.\n\n\"As for the negotiating process, it's an attempt to encourage us to abandon the territorial gains we've achieved over the past 1 1/2 years.

To catch up, it quickly raised interest rates, stressing many banks, and Fed examiners failed to act before depositors noticed that Silicon Valley Bank was insolvent.\n\nThe result was bank runs and panic. But instead of lowering inflation and preventing recession, many of the Fed’s 400 economists are busy fighting climate change. [emphasis, links added]\n\nExamples of climate activism abound.\n\nThis year the Fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports on their climate vulnerability in a “pilot project” that is sure to expand and might lead to lending restrictions.\n\nA query of the Fed’s listing of recent publications returns hundreds of research papers, press releases, and policy statements related to climate change. The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May, in which 27 Fed economists participated.\n\nWith all this effort, one might hope the Fed would produce high-quality research on climate change. But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis.\n\nThese studies on the effect of temperature on U.S. and world economic growth are cited without a hint of skepticism and widely lavished with media attention. I’ve managed to debunk both.\n\nIn the September issue of Econ Journal Watch, I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S.\n\nI showed that the paper had serious problems with its statistical reasoning and robustness. My analysis concluded that the data used in the paper showed no meaningful relationship between temperatures and growth.\n\nMore recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above-normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely.\n\nThe original study used sophisticated statistical techniques but failed to report that its primary finding was statistically insignificant. My request to the study’s author for computer code to reproduce the paper’s results went unanswered.\n\nI managed to write the code from scratch and exactly replicate the results, allowing me to run additional tests that the author didn’t report.\n\nThe author’s primary result—that temperature has a bigger effect in bad than in good economic times—turned out to be statistically insignificant. Additional analysis showed that there is no reliable effect of temperature on growth at all.\n\nThere are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth. First, each country in the sample had equal weight in the analysis.\n\nChina had the same weight as St. Vincent though China’s population is 13,000 times as large. Equal weighting means that some small countries with unusual histories of economic growth greatly influenced the results.\n\nThe paper’s results disappeared when countries like Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea—which had economic catastrophes and bonanzas unrelated to climate change—were omitted.\n\nOmitting similar countries representing less than 1% of the world’s gross domestic product was enough to eliminate the paper’s result. The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries.\n\nThere’s a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth: Many poor countries have warm climates.\n\nA warm climate doesn’t preclude economic growth, as is demonstrated by Florida, Arizona, Taiwan, Singapore, and several Persian Gulf states. But the average poor country is warmer than the average rich country.\n\nDebate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal, but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year-to-year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth.\n\nThe paper claims that its method controls for long-term differences in climate, but using simulated data I found that the Fed paper’s method can be fooled into finding an effect that doesn’t exist.\n\nThe only thing to learn from the Fed’s research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast, and when it comes to climate, academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts.\n\nThe Fed’s time would be better spent on more urgent matters, like improving its botched regulation of the banking system.\n\nh/t Steve B.\n\nRead more at WSJ\n\nJoin our list\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_100038.txt": {"the Fed": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}}}}

However, the application was prepared by an Irish environmental consulting group, not Trump’s business. The application clearly uses global warming to add urgency to a permit application to build a seawall which will protect his property from erosion and storms.\n\nTrump’s previous attempts to build the seawall failed to win special approval from Ireland’s national government, so his business resubmitted the application citing global warming as the motivating factor. The seawall would consist of 200,000 tons of rock distributed along two miles of beach in front of Trump’s property.\n\n“The zoning application raises further questions about how the billionaire developer would confront a risk he has publicly minimized but that has been identified as a defining challenge of this era by world leaders, global industry and the American military,” claims Politico. “His public disavowal of climate science at the same time he moves to secure his own holdings against the effects of climate change also illustrates the conflict between his political rhetoric and the realities of running a business with seaside assets in the 21st century.”\n\nThe real estate mogul has a long history of skepticism about global warming. Trump has taken to Twitter to call global warming a “hoax,” “mythical,” a “con job,” “nonexistent,” and “bullshit.” Trump also has a long history of questioning the benefits of politically popular green power in favor of conventional energy sources. He views policies created to fight global warming as hurting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness with China. Trump has also vowed to “at a minimum” renegotiate the United Nation’s December’s Paris climate deal.\n\nTrump has also expressed extreme skepticism of wind and solar power which environmentalists claim are the best way to prevent global warming.\n\n“I will say wind is a problem because it’s very expensive to build the towers, very, very expensive, and as you know when you have 40-dollar oil, it’s not economics, so they’re going to have to do a subsidy, otherwise wind isn’t going to work,” Trump said when pointing out problems with wind energy to The Washington Post.\n\nTrump even sued to prevent the construction of a new wind farm in Scotland which would have spoiled the view of a luxury golf resort he owns. Trump publicly stated he would stop development of the resort if the wind farm project went ahead.\n\nTrump has vehemently opposed wind power on Twitter, saying “nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy–a disaster for taxpayers” and asking “How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.”\n\nTrump’s skepticism of solar power is equally well documented, as he said in a 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren that solar panels are “economically, they’re not good. It’s a very, very poor form of energy. Solar, as you know, hasn’t caught on because, I mean, a solar panel takes 32 years — it’s a 32-year payback. Who wants a 32-year payback? The fact is, the technology is not there yet.”\n\nTrump’s stance on solar is markedly different from that of his likely Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who plans to build “half a billion” solar panels. One of Clinton’s biggest financial backers, hedge fund billionaire Warren Buffett, has invested billions into building just that type of solar panel.\n\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200113.txt": {"Trump": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}

{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_UA_300108.txt:\n'Vantage | Is poisoning of Ukraine spy chief's wife part of old Russia playbook? \n\n As the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its grim second year, a new and ominous chapter has unfolded with the poisoning of Marianna Budanova, the wife of Ukraine’s spy chief, Kyrylo Budanov. This incident marks a disturbing turn in the ongoing hostilities between the two nations, raising questions about the methods employed and the potential infiltration of intelligence agencies.\n\nThe conflict has reached a virtual stalemate with both sides fortifying their positions as winter sets in. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s counteroffensive has stalled and Russia maintains its occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine. As the war approaches its two-year mark, tensions continue to escalate.\n\nF-16 factor\n\nThe focus now shifts to the military strategies employed by both sides. Ukraine is placing its hopes on the acquisition of F-16 fighter jets with expectations of receiving the first batch before the new year. Meanwhile, Russia appears to be resorting to covert tactics introducing the alarming element of poison into the conflict.\n\nThe use of poison, a notorious tool in Putin’s arsenal to silence critics, has now found its way to the Ukrainian battlefield. Marianna Budanova has become the first known target of this insidious method. Reports indicate that the Ukrainian intelligence unit G-U-R, responsible for the country’s security, has confirmed her poisoning along with several other officials, all now hospitalised.\n\nThe aftermath of Marianna Budanova’s poisoning raises serious questions about a potential breach in Ukraine’s intelligence unit. Accusations are being thrown between the two nations with Russia placing blame on Ukraine citing it as a case of infighting. This incident sheds light on the vulnerability of high-profile Ukrainian leaders and their families.\n\nKyrylo Budanov: A targeted spy chief\n\nKyrylo Budanov, a 37-year-old Lieutenant General and chief of Ukraine’s main spy agency since 2020, has been a thorn in Moscow’s side. Known for orchestrating attacks deep inside Russian territory, Budanov has survived at least 10 assassination attempts including a botched car bombing in 2019. His actions have made him a hate figure in Russia further escalating tensions.\n\nMoscow has levied charges against Budanov, linking his unit to the killings of pro-war Russian figures, including Vladlen Tatarsky, a blogger, and Darya Dugina, a journalist and the daughter of a close ally of Putin. These charges make Budanov a prime target for Russian agencies.\n\nHistory of covert poisoning in Russia\n\nThe use of poison as a weapon is not new in Russian tactics. Notable victims include Alexei Navalny, Putin’s vocal opposition politician currently serving a 30-year jail term, and the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London. The recurring theme of poisoning critics underscores the ruthless methods employed by Russian intelligence.\n\nThe poisoning of Marianna Budanova adds a sinister dimension to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As the war rages on, the international community watches with concern, grappling with the use of poison as a tool of war. The incident raises urgent questions about the safety of high-profile individuals and the potential infiltration of intelligence units, further complicating an already volatile situation.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300108.txt": {"Marianna Budanova": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "Putin": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Tyrant"]}, "Alexei Navalny": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "Sergei Skripal": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "Russian intelligence": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Terrorist"]}}}}

This is their area of responsibility — this is the outcome of their policy and rule,” Putin said.\n\nAt the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Davos that the conflict would need to escalate.\n\n\"Moscow has bluffed before with its threats. On the contrary, we need to escalate now because Putin understands only the language of force. If Russia's defeat leads to the collapse of the Putin regime, Europe may become safer and the world — freer and more democratic,\" Zelensky said.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda supported Zelensky in Davos:\n\n\"The war will end when we force the Russians out of all the occupied territories. This is obvious to me.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken, answering a question about a truce, noted in Davos that he did not see any conditions for a ceasefire.\n\n\"When you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n\nWinning the conflict is an existential question for all parties. The United States is the main instigator of the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Today, it is the US that emerges as the main obstacle on the way to a ceasefire and then peace.\n\nIf the US agreed to sign an agreement with Russia, it would be tantamount to stopping NATO's expansion to the east and thus ending the dream of US global domination and exceptionalism. The United States will be clinging to every opportunity to keep and regain geopolitical advantage. Otherwise, the US financial system based on the dominance of the dollar will crumble. That would be lethal to Washington and the US will continue using Ukraine as a bargaining chip in fierce competition with Russia.\n\nThis suggests that hostilities in Ukraine will continue indefinitely until one of the parties is completely crushed and destroyed. Therefore, Russia has no other choice but to force the Kyiv regime to capitulate.\n\nAt the same time, due to internal contradictions in the United States, there is no funding for Kyiv. Ukraine needs $5 billion a month. Without this money, Ukraine is bankrupt, including at the front. Ukraine's manpower has been exhausted, let alone its production potential.\n\nRussia has been developing its defence industry by leaps and bounds lately.\n\nAccording to Stratfor, if there is a ceasefire agreement, it will be concluded on Russia's terms. Maintaining Russia's control over Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will neutralise Ukraine and prevent its entry into the European Union and NATO in the coming years, Stratfor analysts believe. It is not clear what borders Ukraine presently has. Moreover, Kyiv's formal control over territories does not coincide with reality.\n\nTime will be working for Russia as it continues to develop its defence industry, increase the strength of its army and find ways to circumvent sanctions.\n\nRussia's victory in the conflict in Ukraine would deal a terrible blow to the image of the United States. There is no more \"as long as it takes\" — it has been replaced with \"as long as we can\", Stratfor concludes.\n\nThe outcome of the special military operation in Ukraine will become clear to everyone in four to six months.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300132.txt": {"The United States": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator"]}, "the United States": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}}}}

This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of “cherry-picking” Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a “misleading” story. Being accused of “cherry picking” by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn’t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested “fines and imprisonments” for expressing scepticism about “well supported” science is laughable, if also a tad sinister.\n\nOne of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a ‘straw man’ argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: “Comparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes”. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on ”mind blowing” low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was “outside anything we have seen”. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice “that’s larger than any we have seen” since 1979.\n\nRead more: Reuters Joins BBC in Failed ‘Fact Check’ of Daily Sceptic Arctic Sea Ice Story'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_100076.txt": {"Reuters": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "Daily Sceptic": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Guardian"]}, "Walt Meier": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}}}}

This inventory supposedly tracks the carbon footprint generated by household food consumption.\n\nWith the help of American Express, C40 Cities, and EcoData, Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption, which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use, transportation, and waste.\n\nCommissioner Rohit Aggarwala from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection unveiled the new household food consumption data. Aggarwala, by the way, also founded the Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which collects data in order to forge “a new standard for what cities have to do” as a novel way to shape policy.\n\nWhile the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas “pollution” from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing, air travel, and health care, Adams focused his efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume – mainly meat and dairy, which he personally opposes.\n\n“Food is the third-biggest source of cities’ emissions right after buildings and transportation, but all food is not created equal,” Adams unsubstantially stated. “The vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products.”\n\n“It is easy to talk about the emissions that’s coming from buildings and how it impacts our environment, but we now have to talk about beef. And I don’t know if people are ready for this conversation.”\n\nOther than fish, Adams reportedly abides by a “plant-based” vegan diet, which he says helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices, which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop “global warming.”\n\n“We already know that a plant-powered diet is better for your physical and mental health, and I am living proof of that,” Adams declared. “But the reality is that thanks to this new inventory, we’re finding out it is better for the planet.”\n\nThe simplistic way in which Adams couched his argument against meat and dairy has already been debunked by people who are actually educated in such things, including Melissa McKendree, PhD, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University.\n\n“Different meats have different kinds of greenhouse gas footprints,” McKendree clarified about how pasture-raised animals do not harm the environment like feedlot animals do. “All land is not created equal.”'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200021.txt": {"New York City Mayor Eric Adams": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Tyrant"]}, "Adams": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "Melissa McKendree": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Virtuous"]}}}}

We will not let Russia succeed,” Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nThe White House official said the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will assist Ukraine in printing more than 3 million textbooks for elementary school students in the country ahead of the next school year. Mr. Sullivan said this textbook production effort will take place inside Ukraine and that the finished books will be distributed to more than 12,000 schools around the country.\n\n“Our message is clear: We will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend against Russia’s barbaric war of aggression,” Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nHe didn’t specify how much the textbook production run would cost, from where USAID would draw the funds, or where the new production efforts would take place to avoid additional disruptions from Russian attacks. The Epoch Times reached out to both the White House and USAID for further comment but didn’t receive a response from either by press time.\n\nThe U.S. government has designated some $173 billion for direct and indirect aid to Ukraine since Russian forces launched their large-scale military campaign there in February 2022, most recently allocating about $60 billion for Ukraine in a foreign aid supplemental that Congress passed in April. While much of the U.S. support for Ukraine has been in the form of shipments of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment to assist in the fighting, Ukraine also has received humanitarian aid and direct financial support.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300036.txt": {"The United States": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Virtuous"]}, "Ukraine": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}}}}

Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield.

It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?\n\nThe answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.\n\nIndeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?\n\n\"The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine’s armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,\" the Asia Times report continued. \"The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.\"\n\nZelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts.

ACCESS IT HERE!\n\nAmerican Interventionism Is Dangerous,\n\nBut Is It Worse than the Alternative?\n\nI’ve been here before, only I didn’t know it. When I born in the summer of 1984, the world had already escaped nuclear holocaust on a number of occasions, but the biggest close calls happened in the early 1980s, with one of them so close to a Soviet-American thermonuclear war that the Soviet officer who de-escalated the event is dubbed “the man that saved the world” – Stanislav Petrov.\n\nLike all incredible lucky stories, Stanislav was called to duty at the last second, because the officer originally assigned to the shift was sick.\n\nSuddenly, his screen was filled with notices of nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow ASAP and alert them that in five minutes, the entire country would be obliterated!\n\nBut something stopped him… he began reasoning that had the United States started on the path of nuclear war, they’d launch hundreds of missiles, not just a few, and decided to hold off and learn that no other station was reporting anything.\n\nSubsequently, he learned that this was a new satellite detection system that was totally useless, and that even flares from the clouds and sun could make it beep.\n\nBasically, he found out that the latest Soviet air defenses were garbage and was actually fired, instead of hailed for his deep thinking.\n\nI was born the year after Stanislav Petrov saved the world, including my own parents.\n\nNow, the Russians and NATO members are fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. France is ready to send troops to Ukraine already and, instead of having the country join NATO, it will essentially turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, but president Biden, of all people, is the one blocking it.\n\nNo wonder precious metals are soaring, but do I agree with hedge fund managers that it is overvalued?\n\nCourtesy: Zerohedge.com\n\nIn my opinion, gold is not overvalued, and its fair price is in the neighborhood of $2,582, whereas silver’s is around $37.\n\nIn the next few weeks, Biden will realize that France entering Ukraine, while showing that Washington is playing second fiddle to an emerging superpower in Europe. Washington stands to gain much from this, as it will drastically shift from policing the world to coalizing with other nations and keeping its influence, while isolating more and more, which is a very bi-partisan strategy.\n\nIf this happens, a head-on confrontation between France and Russia will send the human race back to the WW2 era, and I submit to you that French troops will then be reinforced by German, Polish and Italian ones.\n\nUkraine, in effect, will be like the Berlin Wall, separating Russia from Europe proper.\n\nIf you’re shaking your head in disbelief, just know that during Carter’s term in office, a 40c-worth chip malfunctioned once, prompting the screens to show that 2,000 Soviet warheads were en route to major American cities.

{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_UA_103861.txt:\n'The World Needs Peacemaker Trump Again \n\n by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\n\nThe world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\n\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\n\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\n\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\n\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\n\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\n\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\n\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\n\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\n\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”\n\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”\n\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\n\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\n\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\n\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_103861.txt": {"Chinese": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Spy"]}, "China": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator"]}, "Hamas": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Terrorist"]}, "Donald Trump": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Peacemaker", "Guardian"]}}}}

Farming uses nitrogen, and suddenly, nitrogen is the new antagonist in the tale of global warming. The narrative is simple: eliminate nitrogen, and save the world. Yet, in the name of “preservation,” entire segments of our food production are under siege.\n\nConsider rice – a staple for half the world’s population. Renowned agencies claim, “Rice accounts for roughly 10% of global methane emissions,” emphasising the urgent need to curtail its production. But the ramifications? Starvation for billions.\n\nLook to the Netherlands for further evidence. Dutch farmers, the backbone of a nation that is a leading exporter of meat and agricultural products, are being chased off their lands. A staggering number, 3,000 farms, are forecasted to be confiscated in the coming years. The tragic fallout is evident, with a reported 20 to 30 farmers tragically ending their lives annually.\n\nOur friends in Europe are no strangers to these baffling decisions either. The European Commission greenlit a strategy to compensate livestock farmers for halting their operations in certain areas – with a stipulation that they never resume their animal breeding activities.

However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.\n\nThis is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive \"showed the cowardice of the allies,\" especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nSir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.\n\n\"The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?\" asks the colonel.\n\nAccording to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, \"the most pathetic were the Western allies\" who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, \"but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation.\" And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft \"was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.\"\n\nIncidentally, it was these fears and the \"miserable policy\" of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.\n\n\"Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,\" the colonel said.\n\n\"What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,\" Sir Richard Kemp said.\n\nUkraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a \"salutary lesson,\" the military said.\n\n\"Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,\" the British colonel believes.\n\nOnly verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber.

The Daily Wire reported:\n\nThe grant will, however, fund a “facility for mycoprotein ingredients,” the same exact ingredient used to create the fake meat. The Daily Wire asked the Defense Department if these facilities will be used by the Better Meat Company to create fake meat during or after the grant term, but has not received a response.\n\nFake meat has been a favored tool of globalist elites and “climate change” activists because it ostensibly creates less pollution than cattle ranching, although that claim is questionable.\n\n“Within current frameworks, governments can create clear, supportive, agile and efficient regulatory processes to ensure safe and transparent pathways that instill confidence in consumers and industry players alike, fostering a robust alternative protein market in a shift towards food systems that are more sustainable, secure and just,” a World Economic Forum report claimed.\n\nThe push for “alternative protein[s]” is to help countries reach the Paris Agreement’s radical environmentalist goals.\n\nUniversity of Southern California researchers also released a paper in August of this year detailing ways to encourage people to eat less red meat and testing the effectiveness of terms like “climate change” and “climate justice.”\n\nAs LifeSiteNews reported at the time:\n\nThe paper ultimately found that a willingness to eat less red meat fell along partisan lines, with Democrats being more eager to deny themselves the nutrient dense food, which is chock full of vitamins and proteins that aid in muscle growth. Republicans, on the other hand, were “often unresponsive” to changes in terminology.\n\nThe paper concludes that “climate change communications may therefore need to go beyond terminology.” It recommended that “effective communication strategies include using compelling everyday language, presenting clear graphs, emphasizing social norms, and making climate-friendly actions the default.”\n\nThe researchers said “conservative spokespeople” could be recruited to push Republicans to embrace the “climate change” agenda.\n\nAt the same time, some states have begun fighting back against the intrusion of lab-grown meat into grocery stores and onto kitchen tables.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation in May of this year that bans the sale of lab-grown meat in the state of Florida. It is being challenged in court.\n\n“While the World Economic Forum is telling the world to forgo meat consumption, Florida is increasing meat production, and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef,” a news release stated at the time.\n\nGov. DeSantis said the Sunshine State was “fighting back against the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”\n\n“Our administration will continue to focus on investing in our local farmers and ranchers, and we will save our beef.”'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200152.txt": {"Pentagon": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "Gov.

The lies to generate fear and justify dystopia are absolutely shocking \n\n A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries’s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it “entirely fictional” and “shameless”.\n\nProfessor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito – which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases – will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.\n\nBut Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:\n\nThe natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around –10°C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.\n\nIt is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.\n\nProfessor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:\n\nShakespeare mentions malaria – “the ague” – 13 times, so it was clearly once common here. The disease began to decline – for a multitude of reasons – in the mid-19th century, despite the upward trend in global temperatures.\n\nNet Zero Watch Director Andrew Montford said:\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen the Civil Service misleading the public in this way. Science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute.\n\nBut it seems our public officials won’t miss an opportunity to bang the climate alarmist drum as they attempt to cajole and coerce the public into accepting radical cuts in living standards to ward off threats based solely on the perennially wrong outputs of biased computer models.\n\nRead More: “Entirely Fictional, Shameless”: Top Mosquito Expert Blasts Dame Jenny Harries’s Claim That Climate Change Will Make Dengue Fever Common in U.K. Within 20 Years'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_100123.txt": {"Professor Harries": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Bigot"]}, "Paul Reiter": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Guardian"]}}}}

Crucially, we are told, “it’s down to where the jet stream is”.\n\nIn an appeal to authority, without identifying any specific sources, Esme Stallard, climate and science reporter, with the assistance of all-purpose hack Sean Seddon, tell us that “meteorologists say” the wet and cool weather is due to the position of the jet stream, a core of strong winds sitting about five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface, and which dictate much of the UK’s weather.\n\nThe jet stream, we are then told, marks the boundary of cold air to the north in the polar regions and hot air to the south, a contrast which produces pressure differences. And last year, the jet stream was positioned further north, so the UK saw warm and dry weather created by the high-pressure system sitting over the country.\n\nAccording to these BBC sages, what is different about this month is that the jet stream has been stuck to the south of the UK, meaning its low-pressure system has been bringing cold and wet weather.\n\nThis is actually a pretty poor explanation of the meridional flow pattern which has been dominating the weather for a couple of years now, but that is of less concern than the need to tie in the phenomenon with global warming.\n\nAnd here, the formula used is classic is its dishonesty. “Some scientists think”, we are told, as if that is sufficient authority for what comes next. These wondrously anonymous “scientists” apparently think that higher temperatures due to climate change in the Arctic are causing the jet stream to slow, increasing the likelihood of high pressure and hot weather remaining in place.

Is this another attempt to cripple the entire food supply, including meat and eggs, so everyone will run to the grocery stores and buy genetically-mutated, lab-concocted Franken-meat that Bill Gates funds? It would appear so.\n\nNot only are hens unable to lay eggs for months after consuming globalist-manufactured tainted feed, but could it be possible those chickens and eggs are also toxic for humans to consume, possibly causing infertility issues for them also? Local egg suppliers and farmers are blowing the whistle on what could be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corporations purposely trying to cripple the meat and egg supplies of this country, driving inflation through the roof.\n\nEver since October, several American egg farmers have experienced ZERO egg production from their chickens, until they switched their feed to a different kind, some even going with goat feed. Now, suddenly, the chickens are laying eggs again, almost back to the normal rate. What is the explanation? Chickens do produce fewer eggs in the winter due to the shorter daylight hours and molting (shedding of feathers), but they don't usually completely stop laying.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

What companies are the farmers pointing the finger at?\n\nPurina's Dumor brand and Tractor Supply's Producer's Pride brand of chicken feed. These are the culprits, and if you follow the money up the line, it leads straight to the corporate gurus and globalists who are urging all humans to stop eating meat and eggs, and start eating grub worms and cockroaches, in order to save the planet from… global warming. Sure. Meanwhile, at the Davos convention, the globalists are all eating salmon and steaks. So, you were saying?\n\nIt's now more than obvious there is a deliberate war on food being waged against civilians by the globalists. Centralized suppliers, especially those that supply rural farmers that are mostly Conservatives and Republicans, are obviously out to cripple the egg supply, as strong evidence comes from two particular brands of feed these farmers use regularly.\n\nThis tragedy is forcing people to connect the dots and realize that it's not just the hen food that's causing production and infertility problems, but the human food as well. Egg farmers are now on the record saying, “If they are willing to poison my chickens to prevent me from supplying myself or others with eggs, then surely they would poison the food I eat and feed my family.”\n\nThere is a massive public awakening happening now, as food prices soar and supplies get choked out. More people are dying right and left from \"unknown causes\" and it's getting worse by the day. People are dropping dead from heart attacks and strokes and many fewer humans have been having babies over the past few years, since the scamdemic began. Coincidence?

Siluanov said the block on its dollar account meant there were risks the payment would not reach the final, intended recipients.\n\n“The payment has reached the correspondent American bank,” Siluanov said. “At the moment the payment is being processed and we do not yet have reports on whether it has gone through or not. It has not been cleared yet.\n\n“But we know that the bank is in talks with OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) and has requested specific information from us about the purpose of the payment.”\n\nRussia has said it will make the payments in roubles if dollar payments fail to go through but ratings agency Fitch has said that would constitute a sovereign default. if not corrected within a 30-day grace period.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300011.txt": {"President Vladimir Putin": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}}}}

The B61-12, which replaces the previous B61 deployed by the U.S. at Aviano and Ghedi and other European bases, is a new type of weapon. It has a nuclear warhead with four power options, selectable depending on the target to be destroyed. It is not dropped vertically, but at a distance from the target on which it is directed guided by a satellite system. It can penetrate underground, exploding deep to destroy command center bunkers in a nuclear first strike.\n\nThe B61-12s, classified as “non-strategic nuclear weapons,” are deployed in Europe — in Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and probably other countries — at distances far enough to strike Russia. They thus have offensive capabilities similar to those of strategic weapons.\n\nAnother nuclear weapon system, which the United States is preparing to install in Europe against Russia, is ground-based intermediate-range missiles. They can also be launched from “anti-missile shield” installations, deployed by the U.S. at bases in Deveselu in Romania and Redzikowo in Poland, and aboard five warships cruising in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Baltic Sea close to Russia.\n\nThat such installations have offensive capabilities is confirmed by Lockheed Martin itself. Outlining the characteristics of the Mk 41 vertical launch system, used in both land and naval installations, it specifies that it is capable of launching “missiles for all missions, both defense and long-range attack, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.” These can be armed with nuclear warheads.\n\nEurope is thus being turned by the U.S. into the front line of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, even more dangerous than that of the Cold War.\n\nThis article was originally published on byoblu.

Russia eventually pulled its troops back from the capital of Ukraine. Sooner or later, however, the Russian forces will have to take Kyiv.\n\nIt will take the Russian forces more than just three days to take Kyiv. Interestingly, it was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, General Mark Milley, who voiced the \"Kyiv in three days” phrase a month before the start of the special operation.\n\nAccording to him, if the Russian forces go on a full-scale invasion, Kyiv will fall in 72 hours.\n\nNeither the Russian authorities nor the Russian military promised to \"take Kyiv in three days.”\n\nSome believe, however, that this could be real. The Russian army had already approached Kyiv when the West and Ukraine began negotiations and convinced Moscow to \"withdraw troops” for the talks to be effective. As always, NATO and Ukraine did not keep their promises.\n\nSince then, Kyiv has been keeping 120,000 Ukrainian troops in this direction in constant combat readiness. They did not even use any of those personnel for the defense of Avdiivka.\n\nUkraine is trying to play it safe — although it is clear that the Russian army is not going to take Kyiv without giving it a second thought.\n\nColonel Timur Syrtlanov, a special forces veteran, told Tsargrad publication that Russia would need to accomplish the following:\n\nThese are \"Putin four strikes,” by analogy with Stalin \"10 strikes.”\n\nRussia has combat experience that it gained in Chechnya and Syria, and the Russian forces will be \"tormenting” the enemy by working in a targeted manner.\n\nAs for the operation in the very beginning of the armed conflict, the attempt to come to an agreement with the Ukrainian authorities was a big mistake, political scientist Dmitry Rodionov believes. There were expectations that Zelensky would flee on day two or day three за the special military operation.\n\nThe Russian forces should have taken not only Kyiv, but also Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. As a result, the expert believes, \"intelligence errors led to gestures of goodwill that no one appreciated.”\n\nAll illusions about the nature of the special military operation have also been dispelled as well. This is not just a regional problem, but a period of global redivision of the world.\n\nThe West will drag out the conflict for as long as possible because it is benefiting from it. Meanwhile, Russia is developing cooperation with many other countries bypassing sanctions and living its own life, but no one knows how long all this is going to last.\n\nUltimate goals are as follows:\n\n\"It's time for Russia to take advantage of this circumstance. It is too early to attack Kyiv directly, but it is possible and necessary to split this society from within,” experts conclude.\n\nThe Russian forces obliterated a batch of 25,000 155-mm NATO shells in the port of Odessa.

IRS whistleblower testimony in Congress under oath made it abundantly clear President Biden and his family enriched themselves at the expense of America. In short, it looks like they took treasonous bribes, and this may be just scratching the surface. How many other people in the Washington, D.C. swamp got a cut of Biden booty? We don’t know, but the evidence presented this week shows the Bidens, including the President (aka “The Big Guy”), took money from foreign sources, including China. The Constitution clearly says a President can be impeached for taking a bribe.\n\nWhile the Lying Legacy Media ignores evidence of real crime, they are reporting on the crimes being made up by the Biden Administration DOJ. The Deep State wants to jail President Trump so he cannot run in 2024 for another term in the White House. Will they use the J6 strategy that got convictions of 350 protesters at the capitol so far? It sure looks that way, and even President Trump is expecting charges soon, which is the ultimate election interference.\n\nThere is no doubt America is at war with Russia. We keep sending in arms and munitions, and there are no peace talks whatsoever. Now, a bridge linking Russia to Crimea has been blown up again, and the Russians responded by destroying a port in Ukraine that exports wheat. Higher food prices and shortages will be hitting the world soon. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is under attack, and a new global currency is going to be released by the so-called BRICS countries. Is a new currency war coming to go along with the real war already underway?

Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of deceased opposition activist Alexei Navalny, is urging mass protests against President Putin as he stands of the verge of winning another six year term as president, an outcome quite obvious to all observers. She's calling on Russians to disrupt the final day of voting in what's been dubbed \"noon against Putin\".\n\nWhile some sporadic minor incidents at polling stations have been reported, there has been a major incident in the small country of Moldova which borders Ukraine. Moldovan police have detained a man who attacked the Russian embassy with two Molotov cocktails as voting was underway there.\n\n\"A man threw two containers of flammable substances over the fence of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau,\" police said in a statement. A 54-year-old Moldovan who described himself as also having Russian citizenship was immediately detained after after hurling the Molotov cocktails.\n\nThere were no reports of injuries or damage to the embassy, and police said an investigation is ongoing. \"He justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities,\" authorities said.\n\nMoldova has been scene of controversy and friction especially after Russia allowed the opening of several polling stations in breakaway Transnistria, which the Moldovan government has fiercely protested.\n\nReuters noted days ago that \"A senior official in ex-Soviet Moldova said on Wednesday Moscow was breaking laws by printing ballot papers in the separatist region of Transnistria ahead of this week's Russian presidential election.\"\n\n\"Moldova's pro-European authorities have already summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about a decision to open six polling stations in the pro-Russian enclave,\" the report continued. \"The central government said the move broke an agreement to allow voting only at a single polling station at the Russian embassy in Chisinau.\"\n\nThe United States recently become more vocal in defending Moldova's territorial integrity, and has condemned what the Biden administration has called Moscow's 'interference' in the Eastern European nation's sovereignty.\n\nLast summer, Moldova expelled 45 Russian diplomats and embassy staff members from the country \"over numerous unfriendly actions\" as tensions reached near breaking point over the war in neighboring Ukraine and the Transnistria issue.

Security Council, has disrupted lives across the world, as food and energy prices surge and economies stagnate.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n“Russia’s war impacts us all, no matter where we live, from Europe to Africa or the Middle East, and the single best way to end the acute crisis in food and energy is for Russia to end this senseless war and to respect the U.N. charter,” Michel said. “The Kremlin has decided to weaponize food, driving up hunger, poverty and instability.”\n\nEurope, Michel said, is working to help Ukraine, a big food exporter before the war, increase its shipments, and is also trying to address disruptions in fertilizer supplies and rising prices. EU sanctions against Russia, he said, don’t target agricultural products, even though Russia has imposed restrictions on its own food and fertilizer products.\n\n“This is not a battle (of) Russia against the Western part of the world. It’s a battle for the U.N. charter. It’s a battle for the international law. It's a battle for the idea that this is not acceptable to try to change by force internationally recognized borders.”\n\nMichel said he had no plans to meet with the most senior Russian present in Bali, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nChina, the world's second biggest economy, has largely refrained from public criticism of Russia’s war, although Beijing has avoided direct support of the Russians, such as supplying arms. Michel avoided direct criticism of China when asked if Beijing has shown any signs of changing its steadfast support of Russia in recent days.\n\nInstead, he said that the G-20 meeting Tuesday and Wednesday was important to convince all nations present “to put more pressure on Russia.\"\n\nAfter a meeting Monday between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden said the two leaders discussed Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and “reaffirmed our shared belief” that the use or even the threat of nuclear weapons is “totally unacceptable” — a reference to Moscow’s thinly veiled threats to use atomic weapons as its invasion of Ukraine has faltered.\n\nMichel said that Europe must make sure that it creates a different economic and political relationship with China than the one it did with Russia.\n\n“We don't want to make the same mistakes maybe we make with Russia on fossil fuels,” which Europe was very dependent on, “with China, (where) we don't want to be too dependent for the innovative technology that we need today and that we need more in the future.

The DOD is reportedly taking steps to notify Congress of the “accounting adjustment.”\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Reuters that the Pentagon made a “major mistake” that could underestimate future needs of NATO allies.\n\n“Our priority should be a Ukrainian victory over [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. Unilaterally altering military aid calculations is an attempt at deception and undermines this goal,” said the senator from Mississippi.\n\nHowever, the accounting confusion may translate into even more supplies to the Kiev government, according to the agency. As of Monday, the US was reportedly down to only $6 billion in Ukraine aid, from the $48 billion approved by Congress in December. Getting more funding approved is difficult at the moment, due to the standoff over the national debt ceiling.\n\nWashington’s efforts to pump Kiev with weapons consist of two tracks. The Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) allows the Pentagon to send materiel from its own stockpiles – to the tune of $21.1 billion so far, in 37 separate packages. The separate Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) has the US government pay the military industry to make new weapons and ammunition, much of which has yet to arrive.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the Pentagon sent a memo to all four service branches the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Marine Corps – on March 31, clarifying how the value of the equipment should be calculated. The anonymous Pentagon official speaking to the agency used the example of 155mm artillery shells, of which more than 1.5 million were sent to Kiev. While each costs about $800 today, the cost over several decades averages out to much less.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly said that its successes on the battlefield heavily depends on the aid from the West. According to Russian military estimates, the US and its allies had delivered over $100 billion worth of weapons and supplies to Ukraine by December 2022.\n\nMoscow has warned Washington that this elevates the risk of direct confrontation. However, the US and NATO have insisted that arming Kiev does not actually make them a party to the conflict.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300084.txt": {"Pentagon": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "Kiev": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}}}}

America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia’s central command — far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).\n\nHere, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government’s increasing aggression against Russia — using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:\n\nThe Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine’s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President — and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be ‘democratically elected’, and so to continue the U.S.-Government’s control over that country, on Russia’s border.\n\nFor the full details, see this.\n\nSo: all three of those phrases (“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, “unprovoked war in Ukraine”, and “Russian aggression against Ukraine”) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine — which is America’s proxy in its war against Russia — but actually Russia).\n\nThe war in Ukraine started with Obama’s coup, not with Putin’s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America’s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia’s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).\n\nAmerica’s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine’s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia’s central command — too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.\n\nWhat is the power of lies?\n\nIn a U.N.

{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_CC_200227.txt:\n'The Laughing Stock of COP28 – How the UAE Event Became a Farce \n\n\nIt was always going to be a balancing act keeping the credibility of the global environmental talk shop COP28 in check while holding it in a country where they are producing fossil fuels like it is going out of fashion. It might not have been a wise choice of the UAE’s president Mohamed Bin Zaid to give the top job of presiding over the event to the oil minister and the boss of the national oil company, but it was equally unwise for Sultan al-Jabar to have used the event as a way of promoting the UAE and its oil production to other countries. Something about that smacks of shooting yourself in the foot and perhaps Mr Al Jabar’s denials and feigned innocence at the opening day press conference just made the whole fiasco even more of a farce than it already was.\n\nThe UAE tycoon just lowered himself into the vat of sulphuric acid when – in media terms – he couldn’t pull off the ultimate stunt that all politicians dream of but very few actually achieve: to lie to the press and get away with it.\n\nLazy journalists might have just left it at that. But then they started to look more closely at Mr Al Jaber who had paid Lynton Cosby, the infamous Australian media and political consultant to handle all the PR for the event – and decided that the Emirate minister’s unchecked, feral speaking needed a closer look. It didn’t take much digging to find even more controversy days earlier when he more or less mocked the science behind climate change in defence of fossil fuels, leading many to ask how did the UAE get this gig in the first place and couldn’t its elite have chosen someone with more media elan?\n\nThe failure of the event can really be determined by how media were mismanaged from the beginning when the early signs were there back in January when the Guardian launched its first attack against Mr Al Jaber questioning his credentials. That might have been a good indicator that Jaber and his team needed to listen and learn with a serious of crisis management media training sessions which Mr Cosby should have set up and wheeled in the grey haired retired journalists in London to help with the dummy interviews. But presumably, being someone who has enjoyed silencing the press – the UAE has probably one of the most servile press in the world, often with media outlets running front page stories about the elite opening a shopping mall or just repeating one of their tweets – it was little surprise that Jaber believed that the world’s press wouldn’t turn against him. The old story that when you mess up media, you become the story, became the story. Jaber, within a matter of hours, became the focus of attention by journalists who were the to find a good story and didn’t find one from the organised conferences and hullabaloo.\n\nThe UAE needs to think much more about international media if it is going to court the attention of the world. Its elite need to wake up and realise that international press whose journalists fly in and leave a few days later are working from a very different hymn sheet than the local expats who work for The National, which despite huffing and puffing and blowing hot for Jaber right from the beginning made no impact whatsoever on global opinion which has written off the event as an unprecedented PR disaster. Indeed, it was Yanis Varoufakis, a media darling and former Greek Finance minister who put it so succinctly on Twitter:\n\n“UN Chief denounces COP28’s President. What did they expect? Appointing Sultan al-Jaber, the head of UAE’s oil company, as Head of COP28 was like appointing the leader of a pack of wolves to preside over a conference on making the world vegan”. The UAE doesn’t have a satire magazine like Private Eye so we won’t pity those who were robbed of the opportunity to lay on the irony hard and thick. But the lessons are there for the royals of the UAE who must be dumbfounded by the calamity of the event and just how much the whole event has become an international laughing stock.

While the Biden team is pushing for this radical agenda that would limit and harm the U.S., Kerry gave China a pass by locking them into the status of a \"developing country\" according to the Paris Agreement, which Kerry helped to negotiate.\n\n“At the time the Paris Agreement was signed, China was the world’s second largest economy, and had been so for many years. Nevertheless, the treaty you negotiated and agreed to locked into place China’s status as a developing country. That was as absurd then as it is now,” the senators wrote. [....]\n\n“China is bent on global domination. It is the world’s second largest economy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is America’s chief economic and geopolitical rival. It exploits forced labor. It manipulates global markets. It steals our technology. It is building hypersonic missiles and a blue-water navy,” the senators wrote. “It should not get special treatment in international climate agreements. There should be no more free rides for China. That should be non-negotiable.”\n\nBut it's the Biden team, where giving China a pass seems to be baked in, so they're building all the coal plants they can. And they're using them to help build all the green energy stuff that the Biden team wants to shove down our throats.\n\nChina is acting within, and taking advantage of, the international framework you helped create—the Paris Agreement. The Chinese coal plants to which you object now power mines and refineries producing critical minerals. They drive factories building solar panels, wind turbines, and electric batteries and cars that the Biden Administration wants to force Americans to buy.\n\nSo it's a double win for China, courtesy of the Biden administration. Once again, bad Democratic policy hurting the United States and being hypocritical.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200145.txt": {"Kerry": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Traitor"]}, "China": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Foreign Adversary"]}}}}
{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_CC_200318.txt:\n'Green propaganda is masking real statistics \n\n The Royal College of Physicians has abandoned science, and become a green ideological campaigning organisation.\n\nThe RCP’s “green physician toolkit” is precisely the same patronising nonsense as the WHO’s toolkit of the same name, discussed in my Daily Sceptic article a few months ago.\n\nThe two main ideas behind the toolkit are\n\na) that doctors routinely make “unnecessary” decisions that have environmental impact, and that\n\nb) they should use their authority to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nFor example “reduce blood testing where clinically appropriate”. This assumes that doctors test people’s blood frivolously, something equivalent to an “unnecessary journey”. Very, very odd.\n\nBut the most egregious claim, of course, is that “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to human health”.\n\nThat is so far from truthful, and so utterly embedded in green ideology, that the word “lie” is not sufficient.\n\nThere is less than zero evidence that climate is a “threat to human health”, let alone the “biggest threat”. The evidence debunking the link between climate change and health is so strong that doctors have to go out of their way to conceal the stats.\n\nYou can see the raw data here for yourself. Climate-related mortality has fallen in recent decades. Diseases of poverty, which are claimed to be climate-linked, including malaria, are also in steep decline.\n\nI give an overview of how climate-activist doctors at the Lancet are influenced by ideology here, and go into more detail to explain how they lie in this presentation below. At around 36 mins, I show that the Lancet’s green propaganda pages hide the mortality statistics behind “frequency of event” statistics, to give the opposite impression.\n\nThe Lancet claims that “life-threatening extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent”. When you interrogate the data, however, it reveals that far fewer people are being killed by extreme weather.\n\nSo it’s not just a lie, it’s a fraud. And it’s a fraud told for political effect, to transform society and the economy, which ultimately will have a devastating effect on human health. And it already is, if we calculate the opportunity cost for people in emerging economies.\n\nDoctors and medical researchers involved in this propaganda have invented their own metric of “risk” to create “evidence” of a growing “threat”. And doctors and institutions of medicine that reproduce this propaganda do so *uncritically* without checking the numbers.\n\nThe numbers are not complicated. The science is not complicated. The data is not hard to find. This is not like 5-sigma high energy physics experimentation.\n\nConsider this chart from the latest Lancet propaganda report, for example. It claims that the better part of a $trillion is lost from agricultural production because of exposure to heat. But look at how small that effect is in the West, compared to developing/low income economies.\n\nWhereas farmers in the US can tend to vast farms, sitting in GPS-guided, air conditioned, diesel-powered tractors, subsistence agriculture is dawn-to-dusk manual labour.\n\nThe difference is access to fossil fuels. It’s not a weather or climate effect.\n\nTo frame that disparity between agricultural producers in the richest and poorest economies as one of “climate change”, requiring the abolition of fossil fuels is a grotesque injustice. It is vile.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200318.txt": {"The Royal College of Physicians": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Bigot", "Corrupt"]}}}}

Now, it wants to be part of the solution by profiting from the removal of the very same environmental toxins.\n\nI think California Resources Corp. could pay for this sequestration itself in an attempt to mitigate the horrid effects it’s had on the human population over the decades.

That sounds like an admission of treason in the wide open.\n\nBut wait. There’s more.\n\nGermany knows it is incapable of taking on Russia so it is negotiating a secret deal with the insane leaders of two other European countries, France and Poland, for the very purpose of sending troops into Ukraine separate from NATO, although I do not believe this could truly be done without the acquiescence of Washington and London.\n\nAn organization called the Weimar Triangle – composed of France, Germany and Poland – has been in existence since 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe stated purpose of the Weimar Triangle was to assist Poland’s emergence from Communist rule. It’s strange that it still exists but it may have found a new purpose – instigating World War III with Russia.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, “the Weimar Triangle exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries and of their foreign ministers. The collaboration between member states includes inter-parliamentary contacts, military, scientific and cultural co-operation. The most recent summit of leaders occurred in Paris on June 12, 2023.” (Emphasis mine)'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_024050.txt": {"U.K": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}, "German generals": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "German Army": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "Russia": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Virtuous"]}, "Germany": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Traitor"]}, "Ukraine": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "France": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}, "Poland": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}, "Weimar Triangle": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}}}}

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised President Joe Biden's surprise Monday visit to Ukraine — four days from the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of the neighboring country — by saying it sends \"the right signal\" to the world.\n\n\"I am very pleased that President Biden took the time and effort to visit Ukraine, and meet with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,\" Graham said in a statement. \"This was the right signal to send at the right time. A presidential visit to Ukraine, along with the statements made by Vice President [Kamala] Harris at the Munich Security Conference that Russia is committing crimes against humanity in Ukraine, are a powerful combination.\"\n\nLast week, Harris said the U.S. has already determined that Russia committed \"crimes against humanity\" during its war with Ukraine, which launched Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWhile meeting with Zelenskyy, Biden made a new pledge of $460 million in aid for Ukraine, according to The Washington Post.\n\nGraham would also like U.S. officials to go further with their latest investment by sending advanced fighter jets to Ukraine and designating Russia for the \"State Sponsors of Terror\" list, which currently includes Iran, Cuba, Syria, and North Korea.\n\n\"For the visits and statements to matter to their fullest extent, decisive action must immediately follow,\" Graham said.\n\n\"We must designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law. That would also help ensure any lethal assistance to Russia, provided by China, is devastating to the Chinese economy ... we should start immediately training Ukrainian pilots and maintainers, and provide them the advanced fighter jets to not only win this war, but deter future aggression.\"\n\nBiden's visit to Ukraine drew criticism from prominent Republicans, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nChief among Republican complaints: Biden visited Ukraine, which isn't a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but has yet to visit the embattled Ohio village of East Palestine, which is dealing with the fallout of a recent 50-car train derailment, toxic chemical spill, and subsequent chemical explosion.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300035.txt": {"President Joe Biden": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Guardian"]}, "Russia": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Terrorist"]}}}}

SEP/IYSSE public meeting in Sri Lanka \n\n The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Sri Lanka are holding an online meeting entitled “Oppose imperialist war!” on Thursday, May 23, at 7pm.\n\nIn announcing the recent International May Day Rally, David North, chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, warned, “A third world war is not a distant possibility. The opening stages of this war are already underway.”\n\nIsrael’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.\n\nThe imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.\n\nThe Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the “red lines” in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.\n\nOne might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.\n\nWar is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.\n\nOur comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.\n\nIn the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.\n\nThe ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.\n\nThe only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.\n\nA struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt. The independent mobilisation of workers on this basis needs to take up the fight to free Assange and Syrotiuk as well.\n\nThe burning need is for a new revolutionary leadership in the working class based on socialist internationalism to abolish the source of militarism, austerity, authoritarianism and all sorts of social misery—the capitalist system.\n\nWe invite you to participate in this important meeting.

She is not a trusted source of information but rather a Deep State puppet who pushes propaganda unsuccessfully. Yellen wants you to believe that America’s economy is stronger than ever with unlimited funds for all besides the actual citizens who pay taxes.\n\n\nWhen asked if America could fund two major wars, Yellen told Sky News, “Absolutely!”.\n\n“America can certainly afford to stand with Israel and to support Israel’s military needs, and we also can and must support Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The American economy is doing extremely well,” Yellen said.\n\nThe US national debt is now at $33.56 trillion with a defense budget of around $800 billion. We are funding layaway wars with no intention of ever paying back a penny to our debtors. They may strategize war, but they’re not strategizing war from an economic standpoint.\n\nChina was the largest purchaser of US debt but they have been abandoning US debt and the dollar entirely.\n\nYellen called the US debt downgrade “arbitrary” when Fitch Ratings downgraded US long-term debt late from AAA to AA+. The agency cited the debt ceiling negotiations and frequent government shutdowns as one of the reasons for the downgrade, and this was prior to the US losing its Speaker of the House for the first time in history.\n\nAnother reason is simply that China is disinvesting in the dollar.\n\nThe $2 billion sent to Israel is merely the beginning since the full-scale war has not yet begun. The two wars will merge into one when other nations become involved.\n\nIsrael could easily defeat Palestine on its own without foreign aid. But once the major players like China and Russia intervene it will take the full force and funding of NATO.\n\nWar has become the #1 economic priority for America’s politicians. “We” do not want to fund any wars but have no say in the matter since the elections are rigged, the data is inaccurate, and the truth is concealed by lie after lie.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300022.txt": {"Janet Yellen": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent", "Deceiver"]}}}}

U.S.-Government-approved ‘news’-media accept and amplify that assumption, but “MoA” does not.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nFirst, he quotes the New York Times and other U.S. Government mouthpieces presenting the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ of the blow-up; and then he rips it apart by noting the extremely relevant (but in U.S.-and-occupied lands ignored) fact, that on May 12th, Britain had supplied to Ukraine its “Storm Shadow” missiles that are designed to have a two-stage bombing-operation: first, a normal surface bomb, but then after it a fuse-ignited ground-penetrating bomb to explode deeper inside even a fortified and hardened underground target such as that dam was apparently blown up.\n\nThe British-supplied Storm Shadow weapon is perfect for this type of destruction — exploding from deep underground, instead of from the surface. And whereas Russia doesn’t have any Storm Shadows, Ukraine definitely does — ever since May 12th.\n\nThe present news-report about U.S.-and-allied lies is being simultaneously submitted for publication by all of the standard U.S.-Government mouthpiece propaganda-media, just in case any of them might finally want to go beyond their standard U.S.-Government-approved sources.\n\nEver since at least late 2022, Russia has been warning that Ukraine’s government wants to blow up that dam. For example, on 1 November 2022, Reuters headlined “Russia announces wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine”, and reported that,\n\n“Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,” Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message.\n\n“Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,” he said. “The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.”\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called “dirty bomb” to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. …\n\nSaldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river.\n\nEven U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media occasionally report relevant facts when they find them useful to mention in a ‘news’-report that has an anti-Russian “spin.”\n\nSo: we know that Russia’s Government was trying to protect the residents in that region against this attack, but U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media have unquestioningly accepted the Ukrainian government’s accusation that Russia’s Government did it. And, now, an extremely likely explanation has finally been provided, which implicates both Ukraine’s government and UK’s Government as having done it.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_102990.txt": {"Ukrainian Government": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Saboteur"]}, "Russia": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Scapegoat"]}}}}

Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.\n\nAt his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.\n\nThey include non-strategic “battlefield” nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.\n\nThey have never been used in combat — so far.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nRussia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.\n\nThey include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.\n\nUnleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.\n\nBut he may not care about retaliation.\n\nThe Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.\n\nHe said: “If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.\n\n“Why do we need a world without Russia in it?”\n\nThis, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.\n\nSam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: “I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.”\n\nNato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.\n\nPavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: “One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.”\n\nAnd US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an “escalate to de-escalate” policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.\n\n'CONCERNING'\n\nMany wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.\n\nBut one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: “Putin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.”\n\nHowever, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: “It is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\n“Both the US and Russia have more than enough warheads to wipe each other out.\n\n“The concept of ‘mutually assured destruction’ still stands.”'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_104434.txt": {"Putin": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator"]}}}}

Meanwhile, throughout the fall, Kyiv has retaken control of formerly occupied territories, most recently recapturing control of Kherson, a major city in the nation's southern region.\n\nConcerns about attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure have grown as winter approaches, and these attacks threaten to leave millions of Ukrainians without power throughout the winter, which could see dangerously low temperatures.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia hit Ukraine with its latest attack on its infrastructure, which Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko described as the \"most massive shelling\" since the war began on February 24, 2022.\n\n\"Today again Russia strikes large-scale missile strikes on energy facilities.

My life is ruined, and there is nothing left for me but irony.\"\n\nHer TikTok clips include one of her in a basement in Odessa, quipping that Ukrainians' idea of going for a walk now is a jaunt to the nearest shelter.\n\nShe said the line between what was funny and what was hurtful was no longer clear, given the suffering and fear afflicting so many.\n\nBut the appetite for wartime content at TikTok appears strong, with Vasyuta and Shashenok seeing their accounts’ subscriber ranks multiply.\n\nYouthful sass\n\nWhile breaking news events such as armed conflicts have featured on social media for years, TikTok tends to feature spontaneity and a bit of sass that has proven particularly popular with younger audiences.\n\nIn the US where members of Gen Z, born in the late 1990s, shun traditional television, online platforms like TikTok are prime sources of news.\n\n\"I hope that the kids who watch this war unfold on TikTok become opposed to war [and] realize the horrors and dangers of it,\" said US high school history teacher Chris Dier, who is also a TikTok creator.\n\n\"What I don't want is for it to desensitize them and normalize war.\"\n\nYoung TikTok users were also being \"bombarded\" with propaganda that they likely needed help navigating, said Dier.\n\nTikTok told AFP that it had ramped up resources to detect and counter \"emerging threats\" and \"harmful disinformation\" on the platform.\n\nOn March 6, the subsidiary of China-based ByteDance suspended the uploading of videos in Russia in reaction to a new law making it a crime to \"discredit\" the Russian military.\n\nThe flow of pro-Russian messages has noticeably declined at TikTok, with the most popular account being state-backed news agency RIA Novosti, which is known for false or discredited claims, such as the alleged existence of secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine.\n\nShare your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you've encountered on The Jakarta Post.

It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.\n\nIf Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to “weaken” Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.\n\nBut, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.\n\nNot only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.\n\nBut even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.\n\nInstead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.\n\nWhen the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its “national security.”\n\nNo one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.\n\nIsolated and friendless\n\nIt might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_014829.txt": {"Russia": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "Vladimir Putin": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Scapegoat"]}, "Sweden": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "US administration": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}, "President Joe Biden": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}}}}

He’d be able to pocket the windfall and comfortably retire. But he doesn’t want to. He loves the land. He loves farming.

The company is among the top European suppliers of 155mm artillery shells, tanks, armored vehicles, and other crucial military equipment to Kiev.\n\nThe Kremlin is calling it fantasy and pointing to zero evidence being presented alongside the major accusation. Here's how the bombshell CNN report published late this past week began: \"US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.\"\n\nThere have been widespread allegations for several months in Western media pointing to an irregular and covert Russian warfare campaign to conduct sabotage missions against European defense and manufacturing companies supplying Ukraine.\n\nThe CNN report alluded to these prior stories: \"The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said.\" It detailed further that \"The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.\"\n\nIn recent months, there have been several instances of fires engulfing weapons and ammo manufacturing sites in the UK and on the European continent, some of which we detailed previously. Simultaneously, Russia has been subject of similarly mysterious blazes at defense contractor buildings and companies.\n\nAs for the alleged plot to take out the CEO of Rheinmetal, the CNN story is sourced entirely to anonymous intelligence officials, making it impossible to verify at this point, other than taking the word of US, German, and NATO officials.\n\nAccording to more from the original CNN report, \"When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US.\"\n\nBut Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations as 'fake news': \"It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously,\" he said at the end of the week.\n\nGermany and the US reportedly foiled an alleged plot by Moscow to assassinate a leading German arms manufacturing firm's top executive. Why is Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger a target? pic.twitter.com/3tsi7jvxGU— DW News (@dwnews) July 13, 2024\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock belatedly appeared to confirm that the German government finds the warnings credible. \"In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months: Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression,\" she had told a press briefing at the NATO summit in Washington.\n\nPapperger himself has since described to the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a \"great deal of security around my person\" - and he's now considered to be the most highly protected private citizen in all of Germany.\n\nAnother interesting aspect to the story is the timing: the CNN revelation corresponded precisely to the close of the annual NATO summit in D.C. at a moment Western officials urged the alliance to stay the course on Ukraine, and commit to supplying more weapons for years to come.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_028103.txt": {"Russian intelligence": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Saboteur"]}, "Armin Papperger": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "Russian government": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Saboteur", "Conspirator"]}, "Moscow": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}}}}

Scotland’s plan to implement “20-minute neighborhoods” nationwide is almost ready to launch, and have no doubts, it’s just another fancy name for climate lockdowns. No, this is not about the pandemic. This is about the governments of the world attempting to steal more freedoms and rights from their citizens, and if you believe you can save the world by staying near your home and neighborhood, then you most definitely are completely brainwashed by the crooked “system.”\n\n\nThe fake “war on carbon” includes restrictive 20-minute “neighborhoods” monitored by the tyrannical Scottish government and the United Nations\n\nIt’s documented already. The Scottish government is prepared for climate lockdowns, where their citizens may never leave their homes again, except to visit the city park (think prison ‘yard’) or the nearby convenient store, then return immediately to house arrest. Every citizen will be treated like a hard criminal, and actually really become one, if the new mandates are broken.\n\nThis is all documented under the United Nations’ “Sustainable Development Goals” umbrella policy. That’s because the “Climate Emergency Response Group” is on the scene, ready to save planet earth from the evil car users and restore the temperature back to whatever it was at before cars were invented (the same).\n\nGet ready to “decarbonize” your energy and land use, while surrendering all of your “natural assets” in ways that benefit the “communities” (big government). That’s right, the Scottish government is planning “future places” where people can walk around or drive a few miles to escape their home prisons. This is also called “local living” and “green space” under the UN goal’s documented “National Planning Framework.”\n\n“National Spatial Strategy” spells out “liveable places” and “productive places” meaning work from home and never leave, except for government-supervised local movements\n\nScotland is just a litmus test for the rest of the world. Have no doubts that once this is implemented and the populace succumbs, it will become a law of the New World Order, run by NATO police and the globalists, to keep the whole world on climate lockdown. This is not a Marvel movie where a few superheroes must save the planet from the sun’s heat bursting all of the humans into flames next month. This is reality, even though the earth is in a slow cooling phase that won’t affect humans for about a million more years. That’s why you should follow the science, not the rogue governments and their insane mandates, if you want to survive this.\n\nScotland’s Climate Change Plan is focused on achieving “net zero emissions by 2045,” meaning their economy will be completely wrecked, the citizens all starving to death, zero employment outside of working from home off a phone or computer, and total government tyranny. The “need to travel” will be reduced by 20%, periodically, until no person shall leave their home ever again, for anything, in order to save earth from global burning.\n\nNo person in Scotland will be allowed to travel more than 20 minutes from their home, and just how soon until even that is reduced to 10, 5, 1, then zero? It’s like when the governments said everyone would have to wear Covid masks for just a couple weeks, to flatten out the curve, then we would all go back to normal. Remember that?

Review of the Evidence \n\n by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:\n\nEight years ago, on 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn recent development, A Netherlands Court on November 17, 2022 found the Kremlin responsible for the alleged attack: two Russians and\n\na separatist Ukrainian” were identified as “guilty of mass murder for their involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17”.\n\nThe media has highlighted the downing of MH17 in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Court ruling is fraudulent, based on fabricated evidence.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\n***\n\nThis background text was prepared in the context of the Kuala Lumpur MH17 Conference entitled MH17: The Quest for Justice, organized by JUST, the PGPF and the CRG in August 2019.\n\nThis comprehensive report provides detailed evidence that Russia was not involved in the downing of MH17.\n\nIt also confirms the insidious role of Ukraine’s intelligence agency.\n\n****\n\nThe underlying objective is to examine the evidence, reveal the truth and uphold the rule of law.\n\nToday, July 29th 2021, our thoughts are with the families of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy.\n\nThe 2019 Conference was dedicated to the memory of the victims.\n\nIt is also a national tragedy for the people of Malaysia. The downing of MH17 with 283 passengers and 15 crew on board, took place barely a few months following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 after departing on March 8, 2014 from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.\n\nIt is worth recalling that immediately after the MH17 plane crash on July 17 2014, prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation, Secretary of State John Kerry and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power pointed their finger at Moscow without a shred of evidence. In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.\n\nAccording to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):\n\n“… the downing of MH17 should be “a wake-up call” to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.” (Telegraph, July 18,2019)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports (July 18, 2014) that “Obama is getting his wish and Brussels is now weighing new sanctions”:\n\nEuropean governments, jolted by the downing of a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people, are contemplating a major expansion of sanctions on Russia as early as next week.\n\nEuropean Union leaders decided in recent days to expand the penalties to a broad new category of people and companies. But the apparent shooting down of a plane carrying more than 200 EU citizens has intensified a desire to act quickly and forcefully, including sanctions against oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.\n\nIn Brussels, some diplomats described the incident as a game-changer. “It would have major consequences if it was certain it came from the rebels— major consequences,” said one official. (WSJ, July 18, 2014)\n\nOn July 22, 2014, The European Union decided to expand its sanctions blacklist against Moscow including Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.\n\nEU foreign ministers decided to “draw up further broad measures including an arms embargo and financial restrictions on Russian businesses, … following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.” (Guardian, July 22, 2019)\n\nMichel Chossudovsky, August 2019, updated July 17, 2020, July 16, 2022'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_010909.txt": {"Ukraine’s intelligence agency": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}, "John Kerry": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator"]}, "Samantha Power": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator"]}, "Moscow": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Scapegoat"]}}}}
{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_UA_026697.txt:\n'The Eurocrats Fear That Fico's Attempted Assassination Will Influence Next Month's Elections \n\n The Eurocrats Fear That Fico's Attempted Assassination Will Influence Next Month's Elections\n\nAuthored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned last week that Russia will ramp up its meddling ahead of next month’s parliamentary elections, which preceded European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova assessing that they’d be a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience. This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.\n\nThe preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his “pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands”. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.\n\nTo be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.\n\nThe targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.\n\nIf the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.\n\nThe growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this. Attempting to discredit this trend as being due to Russian meddling is disrespectful to democracy.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_026697.txt": {"Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "Victor Orban": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Virtuous"]}, "von der Leyen": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}, "Jourova": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}}}}

Here comes the latest Postwar Gravy Train, laden with massive government spending, lax oversight and other goodies for cunning contractors and economic opportunists seeking to benefit from the near-destruction of Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the State Department announced it intends to seize Russian assets in the United States to help fund rebuilding efforts, though the estimated $300 billion here and in Europe won’t cover the projected price tag of $500 billion. “What Putin destroyed, Russia should – must – pay to rebuild,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.\n\nLike an earlier generation of interventionists, Blinken cites the “Pottery Barn rule” – You Break It, You Own It – to explain an aggressor’s moral obligation to rebuild. Colin Powell used the same reasoning in the summer of 2002, as a \"caution\" to President George W. Bush about the consequences of military action in Iraq. A major difference is the dollars at stake. American and European firms undoubtedly are eager to reconstruct a modern, high-tech country from the ground up.\n\nOur government seeks every opportunity to impose itself, at home and abroad, but has a poor track record for managing projects.\n\nNo-bid contract awards, bribes and billions of missing dollars are the legacy of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s rebuilding work in Iraq, where officials concluded that not enough was accomplished for the amount of funds expended. We learned that when taxpayer money is plentiful, oversight and results will be negligible. Just imagine how generous and hands-off our government might be spending Russia’s money.\n\nNot everyone endorses the act of confiscating Russia’s money, pointing to the principle of reciprocity as a reason to show restraint. “Stealing” the assets of a foreign country sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied against us. For example, what if China confiscates American assets to fund rebuilding projects in Libya, Iraq or other nations the United States has damaged through war?\n\nThe DC hype-meisters talk about the Great Power Competition of wannabe superpowers; they tell us that China is on the brink of becoming the dominant international force, that Russia is preparing to seize all of Europe. Here, though, the façade falls away—the elites believe the United States has no economic or military peers. When you’re as rich and mighty as America, there’s no fear of reciprocity.\n\nThe elites will do what’s in the immediate best interest of their friends, which include certain corporations and investors who will benefit from the most extensive international project since World War II. For this group, the only morality is a morality of power: Treating other nations the way you want to be treated is a rule for losers and weaker players.\n\nBlinken and the politicians talk about our categorical imperative in Ukraine, how the world relies on America to “defend democracy” and “protect the rules-based order.” But their words ring hollow. The cynical truth is that what Russia breaks, America will take—using confiscated money to fund a massive rebuilding project that will be poorly managed, but lucrative for the chosen few involved.\n\nCitizen Soldier believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_100411.txt": {"Coalition Provisional Authority": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}, "Blinken": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}

[emphasis, links added]\n\nAmong the groups propped up by the administration is Climate Defiance, a radical environmentalist group comprised of young Marxists who regularly disrupt traffic and shout down U.S. politicians to coerce them into advancing their radical agenda.\n\nAccording to InfluenceWatch, much of the organization’s funding comes from the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF), a nonprofit “that channels money to groups engaged in climate activism.”\n\nCEF has previously received funding from “former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Onward Together, liberal activist Abigail Disney, and oil heiress Aileen Getty’s Aileen Getty Foundation.”\n\nIn its Saturday release, the White House specifically highlighted Climate Defiance’s Jan. 26 tweet celebrating the administration’s “monumental” decision to ax the aforementioned LNG projects.\n\n“Never thought we would see the day. The White House is amplifying our Twitter account. Words fail. Words fail. Words utterly fail,” Climate Defiance’s X account posted on Sunday.\n\nNever thought we would see the day.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., while he was speaking at a New Hampshire diner.\n\nClimate Defiance agitators chanted “anti-fossil fuels slogans” during Manchin’s remarks. One of them, carrying a sign “calling for the end of fossil fuel dependence,” reportedly jumped in front of the senator’s SUV as it was departing the venue.\n\nThe group claimed Manchin uses his position as chair of the Senate Energy Committee to “protect his personal coal company.”\n\nClimate Defiance’s radical behavior doesn’t stop there.\n\nSince its 2023 launch, the group has attempted to corner several high-ranking Democrats, including President Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to InfluenceWatch, on April 29, its members “created a blockade to prevent elected officials from attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner at the Washington Hilton, hoping to see [the president] and demand an end to leasing public lands for fossil fuel projects.”\n\nThe organization’s members harassed Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., at a book launch event in May and “blocked traffic and protested outside” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s New York City residence later that same month.\n\nClimate Defiance demonstrators were also reportedly removed from a June event hosted by the Detroit Free Press, at which Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was scheduled to speak.\n\nAmong the phrases shouted by agitators were, “No MVP.

Boot’s argument is delusional, but then neocons thrive on lies and delusions.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nPropaganda, pure and simple. Boot is an accessory to mass murder, having advocated the invasion of Iraq, the slaughter of over a million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country.\n\nThe hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed “Operation Babylift,” ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.\n\nThe Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as “orphans,” although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as “infants” (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.\n\nThe “rescue” of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).\n\nIn 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.\n\n“The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,” The Adoption History Project notes. “The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.”\n\nA statement issued on April 4, 1975, by “professors of ethics and religion,” pointed out that many “of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.”\n\nThe operation was celebrated by the corporate media and “Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,” writes US History Scene.\n\nUncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.\n\nNaturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude “informational” device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.\n\nRead More @ kurtnimmo.substack.com'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_013710.txt": {"ICC": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "Max Boot": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Bigot", "Deceiver"]}, "Putin": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "Iraq": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "Vietnamese children": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Exploited"]}}}}

{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_CC_200289.txt:\n'Ocean acidification claims of climate cult are based on misinformation \n\n The truth that IPCC and NOAA do not want people to know includes the fact that CO2 breaks down into three different molecules when combined with water. These molecules are collectively known as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and one of them includes bicarbonate ions that comprise more than 90 percent of the ocean's current.\n\nCarbonate ions comprise about nine percent of DIC, leaving invading CO2 levels at no more than one percent, which is inconsequential. This means that IPCC and NOAA are lying about CO2 acidifying the world's oceans when ocean waters actually contain less than one percent CO2.\n\nIt must also be noted that the other 99-plus percent of bicarbonate and carbonate ions that CO2 turns into when mixing with ocean water actually creates a buffer that prevents ocean water from acidifying. This creates what is essentially distilled water throughout ocean currents.\n\n(Related: In 2021, a handful of scientist whistleblowers exposed ocean acidification as just another climate hoax designed to fool the masses into supporting more green tyranny.)\n\nOne of the other myths being spread by IPCC and NOAA involves the false claim that acidified ocean water, supposedly caused by too much CO2, is causing the shells of ocean creatures to dissolve. This simply cannot be true for the simple fact that ocean creatures with shells have protective coatings that prevent dissolution.\n\nThe same is true for coral polyps, which have special protection that guards their reef skeletons against being eroded through acidification. And ocean water is actually more protective than distilled water at keeping these shells intact to begin with, which makes climate claims to the contrary simply ridiculous.\n\n\"Shells and reefs are made of calcium carbonate,\" writes Jim Steele. \"The hoax abuses one true scientific factoid: At a lower pH, the added H+ ions will re-join with the ocean's buffering carbonate ions.\"\n\n\"That reduces sea water's available carbonate ions by converting them to bicarbonate ion. So, alarmists' falsely claim acidification will reduce seawater's carbonate ions, making it more difficult to make calcium carbonate shells or reefs.\"\n\nPart of the climate hoax suggests that ocean shells and reefs import carbonate ions directly from seawater, but that too much CO2 inhibits this. All available evidence shows that shells and reefs only import CO2 and abundant bicarbonate ions, which are then converted internally to a carbonate ion.\n\nIn other words, CO2 from the atmosphere mixes with ocean water and turns into the exact ingredients that shells and reefs need to build strength and resiliency. CO2 actually helps them, not hurts them like the climate cult falsely claims.\n\nThe newly converted carbonate ions that result internally from CO2 mixing into water combines with calcium to form the calcium carbonate building blocks needed for reef skeletons and shells.\n\n\"Thus, any acidification that converts sea water carbonate ions into bicarbonate ions is actually helping reefs and shell-making which only absorb the critical CO2 and bicarbonate ions,\" Steele further explains.\n\n\"Knowing the real science, I can no longer trust the IPCC or NOAA's acidification alarmism misinformation.\"\n\nFurther debunking the ocean acidification myth is the fact that the CO extracted from water, both salt and fresh, by coral, mollusks and other sea life ends up becoming chalk, limestone and marble.\n\n\"Amazingly, despite what we are told, the oceans are not boiling and one can still pick up seashells at the seashore,\" one commenter wrote, adding to this sentiment.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200289.txt": {"IPCC": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "NOAA": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}

Washington announced $300 million in assistance for Ukraine last week, but Austin said it was only possible due to savings on recent purchases.\n\n“We were only able to support this much-needed package by identifying some unanticipated contract savings”, Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement the day before that it is “critically important for us that the Congress soon completes all the necessary procedures and makes a final decision” on aid for Kyiv.\n\nTop US military officer General Charles “CQ” Brown told journalists en route to the Ukraine meeting that Kyiv’s troops are “having to pay attention to their supply rates and how they execute.” There is an “incremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia”, with “incremental gains on both sides”, Brown said.\n\nBut he noted that “even as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.”\n\nAustin said in his remarks Tuesday that “Russia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin’s imperial dreams”, using “up to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.”\n\n“At least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded” since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also “sunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.”\n\nThe sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.\n\nSpeaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. “That includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,” he told journalists.

Although there were no explosions when the first bombs landed, a strong smell of chlorine filled the air. The soldiers felt their skin sting, eyes water, and lungs fill with smoke, provoking a hard cough.\n\nThey placed rags soaked with water over their faces as the heavy gas filled the air. Oleksiy Bozhko, a volunteer medic whose team examined the men near the eastern city of Avdiivka, identified the gas as chloropicrin, a banned chemical irritant, based on the men's symptoms and descriptions of the smell, the Journal reported.\n\n\"This weapon cripples and kills, it's indiscriminate,\" Bozhko said.\n\nThe U.S. announced sanctions earlier this month against Russian companies and government bodies involved in the creation and supply of chemical weapons used at the front lines in Ukraine, singling out chloropicrin. The chemical agent, sometimes used in pesticides, was weaponized during World War I and is banned for use in battle by the Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Russia is a signatory.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions announcement, the Journal reported, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, called accusations that troops used toxic gases \"baseless,\" saying, \"Russia has been and remains committed to its obligations under international law in this area.\" The Kremlin and the Russian Defense Ministry didn't immediately respond to requests from the Journal for comment.\n\nDan Kaszeta, an expert on chemical weapons and associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, told the Journal chloropicrin is toxic to humans and animals, but also acts as an irritant.\n\nDepending on the level of exposure, the gas can burn skin, irritate tear ducts, and make it difficult to breathe, let alone defend against incoming attacks. Kaszeta told the Journal the chemical has been surpassed by more modern agents sometimes used by riot police as tear gas, known as CN and CS, which are also banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nCapt. Dmytro Serhiyenko, assistant to the commander of the Analytical Center of the Ukrainian Army's Support Forces, which analyzes chemical weapon use on the front lines, told the Journal all three of those agents are used by Russia on the battlefield. Although his team has mostly logged uses of CN and CS in the areas they track, they also found two grenades containing chloropicrin at abandoned Russian positions.\n\nUkrainians have been tracking the use of chemical weapons at the front since February 2023, the Journal reported, and the number of confirmed incidents has steadily increased.

{"input": "Given the article with articleID EN_UA_DEV_26.txt:\n'How Nikita Khrushchev Exposed the Hypocrisy of US Interventions \n\n For American interventionists living today, all that one needs to know is that Russia invaded Ukraine. End of story. Black and white. Russia bad. Ukraine good. Support Ukraine with U.S. taxpayer-funded cash and armaments. America good.\n\nIf we go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, we find that things are not so simple, especially for American interventionists, even if they don’t realize it.\nThe Soviets had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba that had the capability of hitting U.S. cities along the Eastern seaboard, including Washington, D.C., and New York City. The crisis lasted from October 16 through October 29, 1962.\n\nPresident Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove their nuclear missiles from Cuba and take them back to the Soviet Union. The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites, followed by a full-scale regime-change military invasion of the island. In other words, they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine. In fact, the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother, secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin “If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.”\n\nOn October 27 — two days before the crisis was resolved — Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote a letter to Kennedy stating the following:\nBut how are we, the Soviet Union, our Government, to assess your actions, which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases; surrounded our allies with military bases; placed military bases literally around our country; and stationed your missile armaments there? This is no secret. Responsible American personages openly declare that it is so. Your missiles are located in Britain, are located in Italy, and are aimed against us. Your missiles are located in Turkey.\n\nYou are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But Turkey adjoins us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other. Do you consider, then, that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive, but do not accord the same right to us? You have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Turkey, literally next to us. How then can recognition of our equal military capacities be reconciled with such unequal relations between our great states? This is irreconcilable.\n\nDo you see the problem? Khrushchev was pointing out the hypocrisy of the U.S. position, a position that American interventionists today simply cannot recognize, owing to their blind allegiance to the U.S. national-security establishment.\n\nThe fact is that the Soviets had the legal authority to place their nuclear missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to join NATO. Cuba, like Ukraine, is a sovereign, independent country and, therefore, had the legal authority to permit the Soviets to install their missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to permit the U.S. and NATO to install their nuclear missiles in Ukraine.\n\nBut even though such legal authority exists, no one, including both Russians and Americans, likes to have nuclear missiles pointed at himself, especially from just a few miles away. This is the point that Kennedy was making when he stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA, he was willing to risk all-out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles, even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install them in Cuba. He, the Pentagon, and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States.\n\nBut that’s precisely how the Soviets felt as well, which is what Khrushchev was expressing in his letter to Kennedy. He was essentially saying, “Hey, you don’t like our missiles in Cuba because they are so close to your country. That’s exactly how we feel as well, not only about your missiles over here that are painted at us but also about all your military bases with which you have surrounded us. How come you can’t understand that?”\n\nWell, Kennedy did come to understand that. That’s how he and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal, one that infuriated the U.S. national-security establishment as well as American interventionists.\nThe deal consisted of two major parts: First, Kennedy vowed that he would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and, second, Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff were livid. They considered Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history. They compared his actions during the crisis to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler at Munich.\n\nFor their part, American interventionists were also furious over Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis. As far as they were concerned, the Pentagon and the CIA had the “right” to install their nuclear missiles wherever they want and the Soviets did not have the “right” to do the same. It’s a position that American interventionists still hold today.\n\nCan you see why American interventionists hated Kennedy so much and why the Pentagon and the CIA ultimately concluded that he constituted a grave threat to “national security”?\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_DEV_26.txt": {"Soviet Union": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Victim"]}, "U.S": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Instigator"]}, "Kennedy": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Peacemaker", "Virtuous"]}, "Khrushchev": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Peacemaker"]}, "Neville Chamberlain": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent"]}, "Hitler": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Tyrant"]}, "the Pentagon": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator", "Tyrant"]}, "the CIA": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator", "Tyrant"]}}}}

Ukraine’s General Staff acknowledged on Monday that Russia “currently is achieving tactical success” after driving a wedge into Kyiv’s defences. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday that troops had “improved the tactical position and dealt a blow to (Ukrainian) manpower” around border villages including Lyptsi and the town of Vovchansk.\n\n“They are shelling the villages, firing on everything they can,” Sergiy Kryvetchenko, deputy head of the military administration in the village of Lyptsi, told AFP. “The KABs (guided aerial bombs) are flying. The artillery is flying. Drones.

Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on social media that over the last day, “more than 30” towns and villages “were struck by enemy artillery and mortar attacks”, wounding at least nine people.\n\nSome areas were also bombed by Russian aircraft, Synegubov added. A total of 5,762 people have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the offensive, the governor said. Over the course of Sunday, Russia “carried out 22 assaults” in five border areas, 14 of which were still ongoing, the General Staff said.

Climate crazies tried — and failed — to glue themselves to Edvard Munch’s 1893 painting “The Scream” in Oslo on Friday.\n\nIt was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and John Constable’s “The Hay Wain” in London over the summer.\n\nThe new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.\n\nIn addition, “Peach Trees in Blossom” by Van Gogh; “My Heart’s in the Highlands” by Horatio McCulloch; “Tomson’s Aeolian Harp” by J.M.W. Turner; “The Last Supper” by Giampietrino; “Sistine Madonna” by Raphael; and “Haystacks” by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.\n\nAs of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.\n\nVideo of Friday’s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.\n\n“I scream for people dying,” one of the activists shouted.\n\n“I scream when lawmakers ignore science,” the other shouted.\n\nThe Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to “Stop Oil Exploration,” claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe group demands that the Norwegian government declare “an immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,” and present “a concrete plan for fair adjustment for today’s oil workers.”\n\nA spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to “pressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.”\n\n“We are campaigning against ‘Scream’ because it is perhaps Norway’s most famous painting,” said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. “There have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.”\n\nBut there’s good press and there’s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.\n\nNorway is one of the world’s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.\n\nWithout much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.\n\nThe art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:\n\n“In recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,” read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.\n\nThese climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped “problem” peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week.

That’s just the propaganda that the climate alarmists would like you to believe. But Marxists often use global warming as an excuse to restrict liberties and confiscate property rights.\n\nData that hasn’t been manipulated by climate alarmists shows that this summer hasn’t seen a record heatwave across the U.S. There is no climate crisis, no man-made climate Armageddon, so why keep pushing the narrative? Because it’s a wonderfully self-righteous veneer for greedy, tyrannical, freedom-hating Marxism. Don’t fall for the propaganda, but be vigilant. The most vocal climate alarmists have a hidden — and dangerous — agenda.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration doesn’t promote toxic “green” energy or target gas stoves and gas-powered vehicles to save the planet. These are schemes to make money or make citizens poorer and less independent.\n\nChris Martz of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow’s (CFACT) posted data on June 26 to explain that evidence does not support the “record heat”/global warming claim:\n\nDespite claims from the climate spin doctors that last week's heatwave was “unprecedented,” not one state set a new “all-time” high temperature record… A total of 39 states recorded their “all-time” June high temperature records thirty or more years ago. Of those 39, 31 were set prior to 1960 and 28 prior to 1950. Six states recorded their June “all-time” record highs each in 1934, 1936 and 2012, while five were set each in the years 1919, 1931 and 1994.\n\nThe Desert Southwest has yet to see a heatwave that is as intense as that of late-June 1994. In the historical record, it remains unmatched.\n\nAs someone living in the Desert Southwest, I can add my personal vouch that we’re not experiencing record heat even within my memory. But by ginning up all this climate hysteria, leftists hope to control people’s minds and actions. The woke activists who glue themselves to streets, splash paint over historic monuments, and swear not to have children because of “global warming” are brainwashed lackeys of Marxist elites. Their life goals are all defined by politicians instead of by their jobs, their families, and their friends.\n\nLoving ‘Humanity,’ Hating Humans: Dostoevsky and Leftists’ False ‘Virtue’\n\nAnd if people are afraid, as climate propaganda is meant to make them, they are a great deal easier to control and more likely to agree with the government assuming dictatorial powers. By the way, I don’t believe the propaganda is quite as effective as leftists would like, but fear is certainly their goal. As the insidious and climate fearmongering World Economic Forum (WEF) put it, you will “own nothing, have no privacy” and enjoy it — or else. Forget the facts that increased carbon is beneficial for plants and warming makes ecosystems thrive — Marxists have a dystopia to establish!\n\nNo major climate prediction has come true in over 50 years. The lies are more ridiculous today than they were half a century ago, but they are still dangerous. We might not be facing our ultimate doom from global warming, but we could be looking at a major dystopian push from Western, especially U.S., leadership that will fundamentally transform our lives.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_CC_200343.txt": {"Marxists": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Conspirator"]}, "Biden": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "Chris Martz": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Virtuous"]}}}}

Period full stop. That was a single, clear sentence. It’s not subject to negotiation from any country, including Russia.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_017310.txt": {"US": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Guardian"]}, "Ukraine": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Underdog"]}}}}

Since the 2014 coup d’état, Kiev has been a key player in modern slavery, particularly for human trafficking and sexual exploitation networks. The political and social instability that has affected the country since the Western-led regime change operation is one of the main factors for the growth of such human rights violations.\n\nA recent investigative report published by the Foundation to Battle Injustice showed in details the seriousness of the slave trade in Ukraine. According to the organization, Kiev has become one of the main global hubs in the human trafficking market, with free exploitation and circulation of irregular workers – in addition to the well-known trafficking of women and children in the predatory sex market.\n\nThe study points out that more than 300,000 Ukrainians were victims of the slave market between 1991 and 2021. This situation, however, has deteriorated even further since Vladimir Zelensky came to power. It is estimated that since the beginning of Zelensky’s government, more than 550,000 Ukrainians have been enslaved. These numbers are alarming and place Ukraine as one of the main agents of human trafficking in the entire world.\n\nIn its report, citing sources familiar with the topic and several insiders, the Foundation exposed how the slave trade in Ukraine is not limited to the exploitation of Ukrainian citizens. Since 2021, two reception centers for refugees from Africa have been operating in Ternopil. These facilities were used not only for receiving migrants but also for selling them on the European black market. An alleged member of the Ukrainian Presidential Cabinet, on condition of anonymity, reported to investigators that the organizer of the Ukrainian human trafficking network is Ruslan Stefanchuk, current chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.\n\nIt is said that Stefanchuk is the main beneficiary and coordinator of human trafficking networks in Ukraine, working both in the sale of Ukrainian citizens on the international black market and in the exploitation of foreigners who arrive through migratory flows and are handed over to criminal networks in Europe. Relatives of the Ukrainian parliamentarian also appear to be involved in such activities, as a large network of private companies is legally registered in the name of people close to him, such as his brother, Mykola Stefanchuck, and his wife, Marina Stefanchuk.\n\nStefanchuk and his relatives’ companies have the function of disguising the slave trade, making it appear to be a legal business. Advertisements are made to “help” people in various ways, such as offering employment or financial assistance. Thus, migrants, refugees and vulnerable Ukrainians are lured into meetings and interviews by supposedly legal and responsible companies, but soon after the meetings their documents are confiscated, and these people are captured and handed over to criminal networks.\n\n“Everything is built to look as legal as possible. Ukrainian women, children and men are invited for interviews at respectable companies in Kiev, Ternopil, Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk. They are made tempting financial offers and paradisiacal working conditions. Then, under a plausible pretext, their identity cards are confiscated. After that, they can do absolutely anything they want with them,” source told investigators.\n\nThis type of situation is not surprising. In Ukraine, several crimes are committed with impunity by high-ranking state officials. Illegal work, sexual exploitation of women and children, military enlistment of children and even organ trafficking have been frequently reported in the country. It is worth remembering the case of Vasily Prozorov, a former Ukrainian secret service agent who emigrated to Russia and has done important work exposing Kiev’s crimes. According to him, there is a criminal network of trafficking and exploitation of Ukrainian children in pedophile schemes in which Western officials are deeply involved.\n'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_300139.txt": {"Kiev": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}, "Vladimir Zelensky": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Incompetent", "Corrupt"]}, "Ruslan Stefanchuk": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}, "Mykola Stefanchuck": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}, "Marina Stefanchuk": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Corrupt"]}, "Ukrainians": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Exploited", "Victim"]}, "Vasily Prozorov": {"main_role": "Protagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Martyr"]}}}}

Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.\n\nEveryone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nNow, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call “talking their book.” In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.\n\nSo, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin’s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.\n\nI’ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.\n\nHow many of you thought Putin was “all there” in the Tucker interview?\n\nIf he seemed lucid to you, it’s because Biden is your comparison.\n\nI thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t\n\n— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024\n\nThis was the kindest of the ‘bad takes’ I found on this. But I’m having one of Scott’s “One movie, two screens,” moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than “unhinged.” In fact, he looked as calm as I’ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.\n\nBut this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.\n\nBy contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the “media” on his blog over the weekend.\n\nWhat’s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin’s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their “analysis” focused on steering the conversation to Putin’s ‘false history’ of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThis way that ‘false history’ would dominate everyone’s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.\n\nThen to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a “useful idiot,” and “puppy dog” and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary’s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson’s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.\n\nWe were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.\n\nSo, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.\n\nI know… in other news water is wet and women want more sex when they’re fertile.'\nClassify the entities within the article into one of these primary roles:\n'Protagonist', 'Antagonist', 'Innocent'\nAnd one or more of these fine-grained roles:\nIf it's a protagonist: 'Guardian', 'Martyr', 'Peacemaker', 'Rebel', 'Underdog', 'Virtuous'\nIf it's an antagonist: 'Instigator', 'Conspirator', 'Tyrant', 'Foreign Adversary', 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Saboteur', 'Corrupt', 'Incompetent', 'Terrorist', 'Deceiver', 'Bigot'\nIf it's an innocent: 'Forgotten', 'Exploited', 'Victim', 'Scapegoat'\nBased on the author's sentiment, provide the output in JSON format.\n", "output": {"EN_UA_023008.txt": {"Davos/UK dominated media": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}, "Carlson": {"main_role": "Innocent", "fine_grained_roles": ["Scapegoat"]}, "Hillary Clinton": {"main_role": "Antagonist", "fine_grained_roles": ["Deceiver"]}}}}
